I'm looking for a bento box, it cant be pinku (that's Japanese for pink) or any girl color. 
It has to be of 2 or more kotoba (that's Japanese for 2 compartments) and has be be chibi (small) sized. 
And has to be really kawaii (cute). Also It has to be about 10-20 bux. 
And you have to post pics of it first (i want to make shure it's kawaii [cute]). 
And it would be nice if it came with matching chopstick holder (WITH chopsticks). 
OH! and it CANNOT have any cartoon pictures, or be made out of plastic. It has to be made of ceramic, or something like that. 
Also it would be nice if it was made in japan. and not in china or corea (Korea) or whatever. 
I have found a bento box similar to the one im describing in e-bay, but it was 1 kotoba, 
and i don't want my gohan (rice) to touch my other things (it can get wet and i would not like that, plus 2 compartments looks more kawaii)
