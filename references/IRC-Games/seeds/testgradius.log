00:57 < swiss> 14
00:57 < zero-one> seriously just wait a minute
00:58 < swiss> /bin/sh: 1: 10: not found
00:58 < swiss> dammit
00:58 < swiss> /bin/sh: 1: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting "do")
00:58 < hotdogs>  /exec -o command
00:58 < swiss> noooo
00:58 < hotdogs> echo {1..20}
00:59 < swiss> {10..1}

00:59 < swiss> that's what i've been trying
00:59 < hotdogs> nope
00:59 < swiss> 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

01:00 < swiss> 0
01:48 < hotdogs> and that's why I don't play with zero-one's roommate
01:48 < hotdogs> zero-one: didn't he have a different account when we used to play with him?
01:48 < hotdogs> where did jaetheman come from
01:50 < swiss> he's on my friendslist for some reason
01:51 < hotdogs> I think the problem is that he always gets sent top because he's level 30 but he doesn't know how to last hit so there's a lot of lost gold
01:52 < chrislz> yeah
01:52 < chrislz> i love laning with him cause i get lots of last hits
01:52 < chrislz> but i hate laning with him because he sucks balls
01:52 < hotdogs> well I'm afraid that he's borrowing a level 30 account
01:53 < hotdogs> cause that could be fucking up our queuing placement
01:53 < chrislz> what aint killin us is makin us stronger
01:53 < chrislz> we're gonna last longer
01:54 < hotdogs> pretty sure we're getting killed out there
01:55 < chrislz> we just gotta have jaetheman lane with swiss
01:55 < chrislz> wait... maybe not so good an idea
01:55 < swiss> lol
02:56 < swiss> chrislz: were you downloading stuffs again?
02:56 < swiss> cause someone was off of port 2080, and it was lagging me, so I shut them down
08:05 < gradius> holy shit hotdogs was playing LoL past 12?
08:05 < zero-one> yup
08:05 < zero-one> it was glorious
08:05 < gradius> SAD DAY MANG SAD DAY
08:05 < zero-one> the end of that game was like...
08:05 < zero-one> ughhh
08:06 < zero-one> we basically kept them at our base for like.. 10 minutes
08:06 < gradius> jesus :|
08:07 < gradius> fucking samba on XP
08:07 < gradius> fucking hate it.
08:07 < gradius> FUCK
08:07 < zero-one> wait what
08:07 < gradius> The schools samba is fucking up on the XP machines in the CS lab
08:07 < alexjandro> What's new
08:08 < gradius> nothing's new, it's just annoying when I'm trying to get to my fliles
08:08 < gradius> fileS(*
08:08 < gradius> fuck
08:09 < alexjandro> haha
09:38 < gradius> How's it feel to not have your awesome Riven player top lane though?!
09:38 < gradius> YOU MISS ME DONT YOU
09:38 < gradius> (either that, or you're glad I'm not there)
10:49 < hotdogs> gradius: it was a terrible idea
10:49 < hotdogs> as usual
10:49 < hotdogs> gradius: tell them to upgrade their lab
10:49 < alexjandro> hotdogs: you're so mean
10:50 < hotdogs> that was the response when I brought it up
10:50 < hotdogs> alexjandro: what's wrong
10:55 < timtimmah> gradius: Riven is still an awesome puzzle game to me
10:55 < timtimmah> Your sentance make no sense to me
10:55 < gradius> timtimmah: I'm sorry. Riven is my favorite LoL character.
10:55 < gradius> hah.
10:59 < timtimmah> I figured :P

12:21 < sunrise> hotdogs: how are you today?
12:21 < hotdogs> I'm okay
12:21 < hotdogs> shouldn't have played lol until 2, but I never should and I always do
12:22 < timtimmah> Should play tribes until 2 instead :P
12:22 < timtimmah> http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/
12:23 < sunrise> I was up unyil 4:30 :(
12:23 < hotdogs> timtimmah: what's the other term besides sandraker
12:23 < hotdogs> butchers
12:23 < hotdogs> sandraker is so much better though
12:23 < timtimmah> Blood Eagle and Diamond Sword
12:24 < timtimmah> Butchers and Sandrakers
12:24 < timtimmah> yes
12:24 < timtimmah> If my server can handle it, I think I'll run a private dayz server until we get on our feet
12:25 < hotdogs> here let me run it on my 128mb linux vps
12:25  * timtimmah is now curious what the specs are
12:28 < timtimmah> Can't run it on my server, private servers are not allowed
12:29 < hotdogs> persistent world baby
12:29 < hotdogs> sunrise: why were you up so late
12:30 < sunrise> I was modeling O.o

12:31 < sunrise> haha my friend Ian was getting shots for his portfolio show in june
12:32 < hotdogs> ahhh
12:46 < gradius> sunrise: do we get to see these "modeling" pictures?
12:46 < gradius> You know, for science.
12:47 < alexjandro> yes
12:47 < alexjandro> science
12:53 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz
12:53 < gradius> hotdogs: zero-one is interested in dayz as well.
12:54 < timtimmah> gradius: nice
12:54 < timtimmah> also, no private servers allowed
12:54 < timtimmah> makes sense, actually
12:55 < gradius> timtimmah: ah k, that does make sense though
12:56 < timtimmah> Apparently servers can use > 2tb of bandwidth easy
12:56 < timtimmah> NOT A TYPO
12:56 < gradius> holy shit.
12:56 < timtimmah> yep
12:56 < alexjandro> daily, weekly, monthly?
12:56 < timtimmah> montly

12:57 < gradius> Still sounds fun, very intersted in this game :)
12:57 < timtimmah> oh yeah
12:57 < gradius> so now we have 4, which is a good size squad :)
12:57 < gradius> next week for sure.
12:57 < timtimmah> I think we could squad up after joining a server, and then from there we can find each other
12:58 < gradius> yeah
12:58 < gradius> ohshi
12:58 < timtimmah> instead of mumble or whatnot
12:58 < gradius> class :|

12:58 < gradius> yah
12:58 < timtimmah> gogo

12:59 < alexjandro> it looks interesting
12:59 < timtimmah> 30 bux on steam
12:59 < timtimmah> for the arma 2 + expansion
12:59 < timtimmah> then free mod
13:00 < timtimmah> we might need a #swift-dayz
13:01 < alexjandro> hrmmm
13:01 < alexjandro> grrr

13:05 < zero-one> WE NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME

13:08 < gradius> timtimmah: nice
13:09 < gradius> well at least we have 4
13:09 < gradius> and im sure we could get together, we dont have too much trouble for LoL
13:09 < gradius> also, we can make a swift-dayz if we need to haha
13:09 < timtimmah> truth
13:09 < timtimmah> I'm always on my mumble
13:10 < gradius> zero-one: you're excited for it now huh?
13:11 < gradius> if we get more popluarity beyond just #testgradius, like other people from swift
13:11 < gradius> we can make that channel
13:11 < gradius> otherwise its fine in here
13:17 < gradius> I have Diablo 3 waiting to be played, but I haven't touched it yet because of Day Z.

13:52 < gradius> I told him we're Internet friends, so we'll get him lots of publicity.

19:53 < hotdogs> lol
20:38 < hotdogs> is it lol time
20:40 < swiss> I'm interested
20:40 < hotdogs> zero-one: have you ever actually looked up builds for corky?
20:40 < hotdogs> none of them build AP
20:40 < zero-one> that's really counter intuitive
20:40 < hotdogs> why
20:41 < hotdogs> he's not a caster
20:41 < zero-one> i don't understand how a character who is able to use AP can't benefit from AP items
20:41 < swiss> zero-one: guess what. Ashe's ult does AP damage
20:41 < hotdogs> he's an AD ranged
20:41 < swiss> should you EVER build AP on ashe?
20:41 < swiss> no
20:41 < hotdogs> his main damage output is autoattack
20:41 < swiss> we gonna play tonight?
20:41 < hotdogs> you use the skills for their effects, not for damage
20:41 < swiss> as in now?
20:42 < hotdogs> also, it makes more sense when you have a full rune page/masteries setup
20:42 < hotdogs> because they'll be heavily skewed
20:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: alright, i'm gonna look up some corki guides
20:42 < zero-one> are we gonna play soon?
20:43 < swiss> i'm on mumble and LoL

12:30 < hotdogs> I believe timtimmah wants to dnd but has no time and will be moving back to SD at the end of this quarter
12:30 < gradius> I mean, it's just a small fourm between a few of my friends, but the more people, the more fun it is.
12:30 < hotdogs> sooooo
12:30 < gradius> yeah, that's why mine is going to be mostly online
12:30 < gradius> since I got friends everywhere that wanna play.
12:31 < gradius> It sucks, but if it's the only medium with which we can actually have a stable campaign then so be it.
12:31 < gradius> Hmmm, maybe I can do a DnD thing at fragnite?
12:31 < gradius> I didnt wanna bring my PC, I was only gonna play MTG
12:38 < hotdogs> play quake 3
12:40 < gradius> meh :P
12:40 < gradius> I'd rather mtg.
12:40 < gradius> I bought a bunch of cards and only have gotten a few games outta them
12:40 < gradius> Gotta build a new deck too.

12:42 < hotdogs> deck building is why I don't play
12:42 < hotdogs> hey your cert is wrong
12:43 < gradius> hotdogs: fuck you I know
12:43 < gradius> I'm not fixing it now.
12:43 < gradius> hotdogs: you don't like deck building?
12:43 < gradius> That's the part I actually really love.
12:44 < gradius> The balancing and rebuilding then playing again
12:44 < gradius> is fun
12:44 < hotdogs> fix your cert
12:44 < hotdogs> fix your cert

12:44 < gradius> hotdogs: fine :(
12:44 < gradius> I will sometime.
12:44 < hotdogs> you're not doing anything else
12:44 < hotdogs> why don't you return the cert you got for a new one
12:46 < gradius> Meh, I'll just use the free cert that was suggested earlier.
12:46 < gradius> That'll work just as well.
12:50 < alexjandro> gradius: did you buy it
12:50 < alexjandro> or did gabe get back to you
12:51 < gradius> alexjandro: haven't gotten it yet
12:51 < gradius> but still waiting on an email
12:51 < gradius> or no emal
12:51 < gradius> hah

12:53 < hotdogs> FUKKIN GABEN
12:54 < gradius> seriously though, if I get a reply back that'd be badass
12:54 < gradius> I had a dream last night that ArmaII went on sale lol
12:54 < hotdogs> that's strange
12:55 < gradius> dreaming about it?
12:55 < gradius> hah
12:56 < hotdogs> I mean, it is on sale
12:56 < hotdogs> on amazon
12:57 < gradius> oh yeah.
12:57 < gradius> Its strange that it's not on sale on steam?
12:58 < hotdogs> it's strange that you dreamed about it
12:58 < hotdogs> let's just buy it bro
12:58 < hotdogs> FUCK MONEY
12:59 < gradius> hahaha
13:00 < gradius> Well I'm gonna get it from Amazon if it doesnt go on sale on steam within the next few days.
13:00 < gradius> since I plan on playing it next week
13:00 < hotdogs> does next week include this weekend
13:03 < gradius> nah
13:03 < gradius> got projects and stuff to finish this weekend
13:03 < gradius> well MAYBe

00:23 < zero-one> should have done this a long time ago

00:30 < DrItanium> c-macros are a wonderful drug
00:30 < hotdogs> have you seen X macros?
00:30 < hotdogs> shit blows my mind
00:31 < hotdogs> http://www.drdobbs.com/184401387
00:31 < zero-one> DrItanium: what's so great about c macros?
00:32 < hotdogs> though now that I look at it again it isn't quite as surprising
00:32 < DrItanium> Can turn redundant sections of code into one liners and expose the differences to the user ;)
00:32 < DrItanium> or code that would be really long
00:32 < DrItanium> such as
00:32 < DrItanium> #define gensym CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym
00:32 < hotdogs> well that's just cheating
00:33 < DrItanium> so I can write gensym() instead of CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym() but they mean the same thing
00:33 < DrItanium> or
00:33 < DrItanium> #define isa(ty, q) CLIPSObjectBuilder::IsA<ty>(q)
00:34 < hotdogs> you should totally do: void* gensym = CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym; gensym();
00:34 < DrItanium> lol no
00:34 < zero-one> hotdogs: wat
00:34 < zero-one> what does that line do?
00:34 < zero-one> i've never seen that before
00:34  * hotdogs cackles as lightning arcs from his hands
00:35 < zero-one> lolol
00:35 < DrItanium> zero-one: void* CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym = CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym; CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym();
00:35 < hotdogs> whoa whoa whoa
00:35 < DrItanium> So hardcore failure on compilation
00:35 < hotdogs> yeah I think you might need to provide more type information on the void* bit
00:36 < hotdogs> I don't think I ever get function pointers right the first time
00:36 < DrItanium> oh lol...I see what you did there
00:36 < hotdogs> hmmm?
00:36 < DrItanium> I thought you were showing how it could fail...not a function pointer
00:36 < DrItanium> zero-one: You can also do this
00:37 < hotdogs> oh no, I was saying using a function pointer instead of defines
00:37 < DrItanium> hotdogs: lol no
00:37 < hotdogs> the compiler will work it all out, right?
00:37 < DrItanium> hotdogs: ......
00:37 < hotdogs> lololo
00:37 < DrItanium> you would have to do a typedef on it to get it right
00:37 < DrItanium> but anyway
00:37 < hotdogs> if you didn't want to write an essay, you shouldn't make your variable/class names into paragraphs
00:37 < DrItanium> #define OnPointerFound(var) \
00:37 < hotdogs> why would you need a typedef?
00:37 < DrItanium> To give it the correct function header information
00:38 < DrItanium> Plus it's an easier way to declare function pointers that you may use many times
00:38 < hotdogs> can you express a type as a typedef that you couldn't write directly?
00:39 < DrItanium> No, but it would get really terse if you didn't
00:39 < hotdogs> also, for the record, I wasn't interested in good/concise/easier :)
00:39 < DrItanium> lol, I am though :)
00:40 < hotdogs> just make sure you #undef at the end, gotta go green and save the environment
00:40 < DrItanium> lol...good point
00:41 < hotdogs> I don't really think that's a good use of #defines though, it will probably confuse IDEs/new coders/etc
00:42 < DrItanium> I'm using vim and this is a bridge between LLVM and the CLIPS expert system
00:43 < hotdogs> then keep "CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym" in a buffer
00:44 < DrItanium> Or just do a replace of gensym with CLIPSObjectBuilder::Gensym when finished like I'm planning to do :)
00:44 < hotdogs> sneaky
00:44 < hotdogs> careful though, if you start using lots of short, lower case names, people might suspect you for a C programmer
00:44 < DrItanium> lol, I think you mean a C# developer who is out of his element
00:46 < zero-one> i remember trying to play with function pointers to functions on the stack
00:46 < DrItanium> hotdogs: The defines I showed you wasn't even the worst of what I've done with C-Macros :)
00:47 < hotdogs> did you look at X macros?
00:47 < hotdogs> they'll change how you think about macros, man
00:47 < DrItanium> Nope, multi line c-macros
00:47 < DrItanium> Used to increase readability
00:47 < hotdogs> yes, that's what these X macros are for as well...?
00:48 < hotdogs> they're not X windows macros or something
00:48 < hotdogs> they use a generic macro X()
00:48 < DrItanium> I didn't think so
00:48 < DrItanium> I'll check them out after I finish writing these object routers
00:50 < hotdogs> basically, you define a table of calls to X(key, val1, val2, ...) for your table, then every time you need to reference that table you define an X() that gets what you want and call the table macro
00:50 < hotdogs> and undef it after
00:50 < hotdogs> need to add a value everywhere?  Change the table macro
00:51 < DrItanium> interesting
00:53 < hotdogs> it's on the same level of mindwarping as the for loop within a case statement
00:54 < DrItanium> Or duff's device, it sounds like
00:54 < hotdogs> yep
00:55 < hotdogs> just those unexpected combinations
00:55 < zero-one> DrItanium: is there any way to make make useful for a C# project? because mcs doesn't spit out object files or anything like that to be linked later
00:55 < DrItanium> zero-one: Yes
00:55 < DrItanium> you just make the compilation command the operation to be executed
00:56 < zero-one> well, that's how it's going so far
00:56 < hotdogs> make is just a dependency tree evaluator
00:58 < DrItanium> zero-one: http://www.csupomona.edu/~jwscoggins/Makefile-CSharp
00:59 < zero-one> DrItanium: why the colon on those macro lines?
00:59 < zero-one> :=
01:00 < DrItanium> Don't know. But I'll delete it if you don't want it
01:00 < zero-one> lol, don't trouble yourself
01:00 < DrItanium> Oh, I meant the file not the colons
01:00 < zero-one> LOL
01:01 < zero-one> you should leave it there
01:01 < zero-one> it looks very neat, i'll try to make mine resemble that
01:02 < DrItanium> If you don't use the macros, the compilation will fail because make gets confused by the : on the dmcs command line args
01:04 < zero-one> i can see that, but i wonder why the colon before the "="
01:05 < DrItanium> Go look it up
01:10 < hotdogs> zero-one: because your colon is first
01:23 < DrItanium> time make -j24 (real 0m7.513s) :D
01:28 < DrItanium> fucking finally, that was a lot of code!
01:29 < DrItanium> Anyway, I have to load my desktop into my car for the trip back to the village. Good night CS LAB!
01:30 < zero-one> DrItanium: you're still at the lab??
01:33 < zero-one> blargh
01:34 < zero-one> this project makes multiple targets, but i want debug and release for all of them
02:05 < zero-one> ah, that's enough for one night
02:05 < zero-one> TOMORROW I WILL FINISH, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME HAVE A DECENT BUILD SYSTEM
02:21 < DrItanium> zero-one: Not anymore
08:14 < timtimmah> zero-one: nope, you forgot to close a loop somewhere
09:18 < gradius> "Perl is the only language that looks the same before and after RSA encryption."

09:23 < gradius> I was like.... "that's where I got it from.
09:23 < gradius> "
09:26 < gradius> Also, pretty sure I'm going to buy ArmaII tonight on amazon. Doesn't look like steam will have it on sale any time soon, hah.
09:27 < gradius> Then we can play tomorrow night.

09:29 < gradius> fuck this game looks so awesome
09:29 < prometheusx> watch, steam summer sale and it's even cheaper
09:31 < gradius> to be honest, no biggie. Saving 15 bucks is nice, and if I REALLY want it on steam, I'll get it again.
09:31 < gradius> by then I SHOULD (fuck me if I dont) have a full time job as well.
09:33 < gradius> tempted to take http://ttp2.dslyecxi.com/images/chernarus_big_hq.jpg to copy + mail and print out a copy
09:33 < gradius> Lol.
09:38 < gradius> shit.
09:38 < gradius> http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/tx1wn/installation_guide_for_those_of_you_who_bought/
09:38 < gradius> I may be buying it from Steam.
09:38 < gradius> Aparently Amazon one is a PITA to install with DayZ, and something about ripping off the devs
09:39 < hotdogs> eh?
09:40 < hotdogs> I see them saying it but I don't understand why
09:40 < gradius> idk, not much basis behind it.
09:40 < gradius> So idk.
09:40 < hotdogs> and I think it's Meridian4 ripping off the devs
09:40 < gradius> Yeah not sure.
09:40 < gradius> and reading through the guide now
09:41 < gradius> none of that is complicated at all.
09:41 < hotdogs> wait
09:41 < gradius> And, also the Six-Updater works with it aparently.
09:41 < hotdogs> meridian4 is their publisher
09:41 < gradius> Crisis averted.
09:41 < gradius> lol really?
09:41 < gradius> :|
09:41 < gradius> fuck it
09:42 < hotdogs> though I'm confused
09:42 < hotdogs> on the meridian4 website, it's $50
09:42 < gradius> Only downside to it now is that Amazon is slow as balls.
09:42 < gradius> But that's normal.
09:42 < hotdogs> yeah, I think timtimmah was wrong, meridian4 is just the publisher, not the reseller on amazon
09:42 < gradius> gotcha.
09:42 < hotdogs> it might be one of those things where amazon says "WE'RE PUTTING YOU ON SALE, GET FUCKED"
09:43 < hotdogs> I think I'd buy it through steam if amazon was slow
09:43 < gradius> I got Deus Ex from Amazon. It was kinda bleh. But who knows.
09:43 < gradius> Go get it from Amazon and let me know.
09:44 < hotdogs> nope
09:47 < gradius> :(
09:47 < gradius> Are you going to get it on steam?
09:48 < hotdogs> yup
09:48 < hotdogs> too bad I don't think I ever set up wake on lan
09:48 < hotdogs> or remote desktop, now that I think about it
09:53 < timtimmah> I can't WOL because wifi
09:53 < timtimmah> But yeah, I'm gonna grab it off steam
09:54 < gradius> well fuck you guys.
09:54 < gradius> Damn it I should get it on steam. What's your reason for picking steam though?
09:54 < timtimmah> a: steam, I can access it anywhere
09:54 < hotdogs> because I like steam in my butt
09:55 < timtimmah> b: I feel more money would go to the arma2 devs

12:47 < timtimmah> zero-one: on amazon.com
12:47 < zero-one> oh
12:47 < zero-one> nevermind then
12:50 < zero-one> alright, installing ARMA
12:51 < zero-one> lol SO MUCH DISK SPACE
12:51 < zero-one> i have to delete a few games
12:52 < hotdogs> hey slow down mister
12:52 < hotdogs> OH WAIT
12:52 < hotdogs> zero-one bought it? QUICK, NO ONE ELSE BUY IT
12:52 < hotdogs> HA HA HA HA
12:52 < gradius> hotdogs: lol :|
12:53 < gradius> so wait, it's 23 dollars on steam for ArmaII and the xpan?
12:55 < prometheusx> gradius: that's what i remember when i looked at it earlier
12:56 < prometheusx> i want job so i can buy more stuff
12:57 < zero-one> gradius: no, it's $30
12:57 < prometheusx> i bad at remembering numbers
12:58 < zero-one> gradius: it's also $40 if you want to buy them seperately
12:58 < zero-one> lol
13:03 < gradius> yah
13:03 < gradius> hah
13:08 < hotdogs> maybe I'll go home during lunch and buy it so I can play it tonight....
13:56 < alexjandro> wait where are we buying it from
13:56 < alexjandro> amazon or steam
13:56 < hotdogs> steam
13:57 < alexjandro> $30?
14:42 < hotdogs> yes
14:42 < hotdogs> combined whatevers
15:10 < zero-one> combined operations
15:10 < zero-one> i'm just going to let it download and it'll be finished by the time i get home
15:13 < hotdogs> copycat
15:14 < zero-one> hotdogs: YOU COPIED ME
15:14 < hotdogs> nope
15:19 < zero-one> hotdogs: so are we playing tonight?
15:19 < zero-one> i get back home at like... 10
15:19 < hotdogs> lololo
15:20 < hotdogs> can you remote home?
15:20 < hotdogs> you'll probably want to kick off the dayz installer
15:20 < hotdogs> after steam is done downloadin
15:24 < zero-one> oh...
15:25 < zero-one> nope
15:25 < zero-one> but that won't take too long i imagine
15:25 < hotdogs> compared to the game, maybe
15:25 < zero-one> 20 Mbps down? i don't think i'll be waiting that long
15:25 < zero-one> i get around 1.5 MB average
15:26 < hotdogs> oh, looks like it's less than a gig
15:26 < hotdogs> http://us.armafiles.info/
15:26 < zero-one> yup yup
15:26 < hotdogs> it downloads those, I think
15:26 < hotdogs> I thought the numbers were shifted over
15:26 < hotdogs> cause then it would have been like 8 gigs on its own
15:27 < hotdogs> then mr big internet tough guy 20 Mbps has to wait an hour to lpay
15:35 < zero-one> lol
15:35 -!- zero-one is now known as MrBigInternetTou
15:35 -!- MrBigInternetTou is now known as MrInternetToughG
15:35 -!- MrInternetToughG is now known as InternetToughGuy

15:52 < zero-one> DrItanium: is there a .NET library that would allow me to format console output like i would with ncurses?
16:09 < zero-one> hotdogs: does botwurst have the ability to be connected to multiple servers from the same instance?
16:09 < hotdogs> probably
16:09 < zero-one> probably?
16:09 < zero-one> what the heck does that mean
16:09 < hotdogs> probably
16:09 < zero-one> how do you have that implemented?
16:10 < hotdogs> http://search.cpan.org/dist/POE-Component-IRC/lib/POE/Component/IRC.pm
16:11 < hotdogs> I'm fairly certain I could start multiple instances of that component.
16:14 < zero-one> i'm falling back into the feature creep trap
16:17 < hotdogs> yes
16:32 < prometheusx> more features are better, always!
16:32 < gradius> we cant play tonight because gradius cant :(
16:33 < gradius> haha

20:10 < hotdogs> I'M BLEEDING OUT
20:10 < timtimmah> OH MAN
20:10 < hotdogs> I think I was killed by the awkward pickup mechanics
20:12 < timtimmah> lol
20:12 < hotdogs> I was running around out of ammo
20:12 < hotdogs> and then I saw a dude in the distance pull a bunch of zombies into a barn
20:12 < hotdogs> where you run into the upper story of the barn and pick them off as they run in
20:12 < hotdogs> so I ran into a nearby building to loot a gun or something but zombies followed me
20:13 < gradius> zero-one: not playing tonight.
20:13 < hotdogs> I panicked and picked up a gun but not the extra ammo for it
20:13 < gradius> just patching stuff
20:13 < gradius> and lol hotdogs
20:13 < hotdogs> killed some zombies then died cause they were standing on the ammo
20:13 < gradius> hotdogs: what'd you use to install?
20:13 < hotdogs> the auto installer
20:13 < hotdogs> http://www.worrom.com/
20:15 < timtimmah> hotdogs: I'm digging that
20:15 < gradius> nothing is popping up when I run mine :(
20:15 < gradius> Should I run Arma first?
20:15 < timtimmah> gradius: don't need to
20:15 < timtimmah> is it detecting the arma install?
20:15 < hotdogs> you should start the game first
20:15 < gradius> kk
20:15 < hotdogs> that was in the instructions I saw
20:16 < gradius> ah
20:16 < timtimmah> ok ignore me
20:16 < hotdogs> are you saying nothing comes up when you run the worrom updater
20:16 < timtimmah> I don't read instructions
20:17 < hotdogs> I was going to make dinner
20:17 < hotdogs> then I remembered there's beans in game!
20:18 < zero-one> lol

20:40 < zero-one> then i can add some fun plugins
20:55 < gradius> nothing comes up when I run the installer
20:58 < prometheusx> give it some viagra
20:59 < gradius> ha ha
21:01 < gradius> getting a 500 server error from the us mirror for the mod
21:07 < timtimmah> gradius: use the worrom installer?
21:13 < hotdogs> yeah, use the installer nub
21:13 < hotdogs> it's easy peasy lemon squeezy
22:00 < gradius> timtimmah: when I run the installer NOTYHING starts.
22:00 < gradius> like no window pops up
22:02 < hotdogs> you need java or something

22:02 < gradius> Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 22.1-b02, mixed mode)
22:03 < gradius> is it because I have 64bit? :|
22:04 < gradius> okay maybe this is an issue
22:04 < gradius> when I run combined operations, it opens a black window then closes.
22:04 < gradius> IE: a cmd window
22:08 < gradius> lol now the phpbb is broken
22:08 < gradius> because too many connections.

08:35 < gradius> This is why we cant have nice things.
08:35 < gradius> (because gradius sucks at coding)
08:36 < zero-one> gradius: Y U DISCONNECT HER
08:36 < zero-one> I WAS HAVING FUN
08:36 < gradius> because she doesnt do anything dipshit
08:36 < gradius> I'm working no not fucking up the mod loader.
08:37 < timtimmah> gradius: still in python?
08:38 < zero-one> >still working on loading modules
08:38 < zero-one> NOOB
08:38 < timtimmah> I want to try and max your ram with a massive string
08:38 < gradius> timtimmah: hahha
08:38 < zero-one> #1. implement interface in module
08:38 < gradius> zero-one: still trying to do it the right way.
08:39 < zero-one> #2. look for interface when loading module
08:39 < zero-one> #3. ???
08:39 < zero-one> #4. PROFIT??!!!
08:39 < zero-one> gradius: i don't work in python, so i actually can't claim to know shit
08:40 < zero-one> gradius: do you have an interface that you implement in all your plugins?
08:41 < gradius> no, im just importing python code
08:42 < gradius> My approach was working, it was just sloppy.
08:42 < gradius> So I'm trying to better it.
08:42 < zero-one> gradius: waitwait. it doesn't dynamically load the plugins?
08:42 < zero-one> dood
08:43 < gradius> It does.
08:43 < gradius> I can dynamically import any pthon code I want
08:43 < gradius> it then goes through and finds all the methods.
08:43 < gradius> and then you can use those methods.
08:43 < timtimmah> gradius: you got that working?
08:43 < zero-one> lolol
08:43 < timtimmah> awesome
08:44 < gradius> timtimmah: yeah, but it was sloppy, and all the mods had to be in the same dir as the driver.
08:44 < gradius> didn't like
08:44 < gradius> and the code was way cryptic.
08:44 < gradius> so airen didnt like
08:44 < gradius> lol
08:44 < zero-one> gradius: if you have to hard code an "import", then you're not dynamically loading the plugins
08:44 < gradius> zero-one: no not hard coded
08:44 < gradius> it was girldius loader import whatever the fuck I want
08:45 < gradius> be it new code, old code, I could reload current modules.
08:45 < gradius> Trust me, I was doing it right.
08:45 < gradius> Just shitty code.
08:45 < zero-one> you have the most recent source on your github?
08:45 < zero-one> i want to see how this works
08:45 < gradius> Yup.
08:46 < gradius> master branch
08:46 < gradius> and calling methods was clunky as shit
08:46 < gradius> I want a way of adding some context sensitivity to girldius.
08:46 < gradius> For example, adding different message parsers on the fly.
08:47 < gradius> Doing a lot more than just reading text, and spitting shit back out.
08:47 < gradius> because at the moment, each mod that I wrote was just a "do some shit and return a string to IRC"
08:47 < gradius> I dont like that.
08:47 < gradius> It was limited as fuck
08:47 < zero-one> gradius: what else is there for a bot to do?
08:47 < gradius> different parsing.
08:47 < gradius> logging.
08:47 < gradius> meaning like
08:47 < gradius> say for example.
08:48 < gradius> I wanted to add a module that remembers everything that rainbows says
08:48 < gradius> I want to be able to write something up that saves everything to a file, load that mod, and have it just log stuff.
08:48 < zero-one> that's a plugin that reads text and just returns nothing
08:48 < gradius> I want to change more than just returns.
08:49 < gradius> Maybe I have too lofty a goal for a bot, but I kind of want to be able to use this loader in other projects as well.
08:49 < zero-one> gradius: i'm going to rape your face
08:49 < gradius> zero-one: Go for it.
08:49 < timtimmah> somebody stop me
08:49 < timtimmah> I'm going to on purpose accidently some headphones
08:50 < zero-one> gradius: i'm kind of in limbo at the moment in terms of features that i need to add to my bot
08:51 < gradius> timtimmah: lolol
08:51 < gradius> whatcha gettin
08:51 < gradius> zero-one: yeah I know.
08:51 < timtimmah> gradius: I'm thinking AudioTechnica ATH-M50s
08:51 < gradius> This is moer of a, "hey that'd be cool to get working in python"
08:52 < gradius> I wouldnt stop you timtimmah
08:52 < gradius> I'd be jelly.
08:52 < gradius> but I wouldnt stop
08:52 < zero-one> timtimmah: get sennheiser
08:52 < timtimmah> zero-one: thought about it
08:52 < timtimmah> but the m50 has great reviews
08:53 < timtimmah> also $150
08:53 < gradius> timtimmah: yeah, if I go sennheiser again, I wanna move up in price range
08:53 < zero-one> do they do noise canceling?
08:53 < gradius> I love mine, but I want more
08:53 < timtimmah> zero-one: no but they're over-ear
08:53 < timtimmah> I don't really need noise canceling
08:53 < zero-one> lol, i do
08:53 < timtimmah> gradius: I thought about going hd880
08:53 < timtimmah> but $$
08:54 < timtimmah> zero-one: lol, I'm the noisy one in my place

17:33 < swiss> well, i didn't get the port forwarding working correctly
17:33 < swiss> and portblocking stops me from having you directly connect to me
17:33 < swiss> if I can direct connect to you that'd work
17:33 < drboots> If we hook the laptops up directly we should be able to do a local game that way
17:34 < swiss> I don't run it on my laptop
17:34 < swiss> my laptop isn't powerful enough to run anything
17:34 < drboots> Fair enough
17:34 < drboots> Eh, could always do it at Frag nite then
17:34 < swiss> sounds good
17:34 < swiss> I'm too lazy to walk to the arcade
17:43 < hotdogs> I bet it could do quake 3
18:55 < swiss> lol 18 minutes in and I'm 5/1/10 w/ shen
18:57 < zero-one> timtimmah: zer0-one.net/Under_Control.mp3
18:57 < zero-one> timtimmah: JUST FOR YOU BUDDY
19:21 < timtimmah> I dig it man
19:21 < timtimmah> thanks
19:59 < hotdogs> so are we playing dayz tonight?
20:01 < zero-one> hell yeah
20:27 < drboots> Damn, need to clean this keyboard already
20:32 < alexjandro> get all the cum out?
20:35 < mosy> haha lol and the lube
20:35 < mosy> it always becomes such a hassle
20:35 < airen> When the fuck did mosy get here?
20:35 < airen> #testgradius? Moar liek #swiftnoobs
20:36 < DrItanium> lol
20:36 < drboots> alexjandro:  I unfortunately do not sink to your low
20:37 < drboots> #hidingfromjbest?
20:38 < DrItanium> Wut?
20:38 < DrItanium> Jesus christ I feel like I'm FOB...fucking kids and your hashtags and inside jokes
20:39 < DrItanium> Fuck!
20:40 < drboots> Your mom is FOB
20:41 < DrItanium> Also, I must have an overactive imagination but I don't see the need the need of lube (obviously there are sexual connotations) with a keyboard unless your worried that attempting to access the internet while going down a slip n' slide just wouldn't work
20:41 < drboots> Sorry, couldnt resist
20:42 < DrItanium> All that I see now is "Live Long and Prosper *gun comes out* MOTHERFUCKER" and then star wipe to the scene of a cute kitten playing with dust motes in a sunbeam
20:43 < DrItanium> The worst part about this is that this all could have been easily preventable toooooooooooooooooooooooo
20:46 < airen> DrItanium: HI
20:47 < DrItanium> airen: Hello!
20:48 < mendez> DO OR DIE MOHER FUCKER DO YOU LIKE MY DUSTY KITTEN
20:49 < mendez> *shoots off your knee caps* YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD, HERE'S ANOTHER
20:49 < DrItanium> But what does it all mean? I mean really, all of the knowlege engines, pointer analysis, and optimizing compiler generators can't solves the problems that really matter. It would be if we were in a solid state society with no moving parts. Nothing would ever have to rebuilt either.
20:49 < mendez> THEN I WILLL MOTHER FUCKING KNEE FUCK YOU
20:50 < mendez> PUPPET ---> SOLID STATE SOCIERY
20:50 < mendez> *SOCIETY
20:50 < DrItanium> We would just stagnate and life would be so much better....well not necessarily...I mean then there would be no innovation and I would probably pull a Hunter S. Thompson
20:50 < drboots> Emo hour in #testgradius
20:51 < DrItanium> drboots: YOU DON'T KNOW THE EIGHTH OF IT. oR IS IT THE 32nd
20:51 < mendez> drboots: FUCK YOU YOU SCARF WEARING TURD
20:51 < drboots> mendez: you jelly bro?
20:52 < DrItanium> There's only one person who can wear a scarf and thats: http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/2419
20:53 < drboots> Ahahaha, thats a good image
20:53 < mendez> http://www.newgamernation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/stretch_panicgrabby.jpg REAL SCARFS GRAB GIANT BOOBS
20:53 < DrItanium> I guess that if I had magical powers it would be something that would be probably the worst thing for humanity in general. I would probably use it to try to make humanity ascend to the next level of it's conscousness (and coscous) whether all of the religious hack jobs are willing to do it or not
20:54 < mendez> THIS IS WHY I WANT TO SPIKE THE WATER SUPPLY WITH LSD
20:54 < mendez> GET HUMANITY'S THRID EYE SQUEAKY FUCKING CLEAN
20:54 < DrItanium> No, you don't understand....none of you understand. I would convert us to something like the organians from Star Trek or convert us to cybernetic life forms
20:55 < DrItanium> Vultures!
20:55 < mendez> DrItanium: no, that's exactly what i'm talking about
20:56 < DrItanium> No you don't, your method implies that people can escape through the magical choice of death by not drinking water. This would just be implicit....
20:56 < DrItanium> Shed your mortal coil and join me willingly or be stripped of it forcefully
20:57 < mendez> DrItanium: I just need to find a more effective means of dispersal
20:59 < DrItanium> Integration with the earth itself would be my contribution. We actually tap...wait no that's dumb....hmmm...integrationr with technology....hmmm fucking hell this is not easy...fucking JC Denton had an easier time with democratization of humanity through forced biomod infusion
20:59 < DrItanium> http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/654
21:00 < DrItanium> pulling yourself out of your own body and look down on yourself would have to be the first step though
21:01 < DrItanium> Implementation wise it's not too hard to do and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn more about themselves
21:03 < DrItanium> No takers I see?
21:03 < DrItanium> hmmmm, this is as sad as trying to get young people to care about voting
21:03 < drboots> DrItanium: I think Ill pass on forced biomodding
21:04 < drboots> What I will take is uploading of my mind into a hard drive database, having my knowledge augmented with additional data, and then transmitted into a clone body that is far superior to my own
21:05 < DrItanium> But it would make things so much easier..full democratization of all choices that the whole of humanity would carry out. Everyone would be taken into account....however, that could lead to factional implemenations if the architectures were on different communication wavelengths
21:09 < drboots> I think yo uhave been watching too much Ghost in the Shell
21:10 < drboots> http://shimmie.katawa-shoujo.com/post/view/654
21:10 < DrItanium> You wouldn't be like a member of the borg collective. You would retain free will and it would mean that your choices mattered
21:10 < DrItanium> drboots: I posted that above
21:10 < DrItanium> Actually the democratization of humanity through biomod infusions is an aspect of Invisible War
21:10 < alexjandro> DrItanium: FOB?
21:11 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Multi pass parser I believe, FOB = fresh off the boot (not boat)
21:11 < alexjandro> okay now im more confused
21:12 < DrItanium> it's like fresh off teh boat but more racist towards nerds
21:12 < DrItanium> like parkour is racist against quads
21:13 < DrItanium> Of Confusion....the hit new series from beyond the grave with Hunter S. Thompson
21:14 < DrItanium> With guest stars: Fleetwood Mac, and Randy Rhodes
21:15 < airen> Did someone say multipass?
21:15 < DrItanium> airen: I did
21:15 < DrItanium> Wowy!
21:17 < DrItanium> "But I had to perform knowledge engineering my sweet! It was necessary for continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility" - Who said that? (SPOILER ALERT: I DID)
21:17 < DrItanium> So how many plains of reality do you think there are?
21:20 < DrItanium> tough crowd
21:23 < DrItanium> Wow, I haven'
21:23 < DrItanium> I dont
21:23 < DrItanium> Fucking shift keys being next to enter....
21:25 < DrItanium> It's really the Masterpiece Mystery in this channel

08:37 <@gradius> Hm, so I got an internship offer from Mcafee... fucking Riot better hurry up :|
08:46 < hotdogs> where is that at

11:42 -!- sunrisewolf is now known as dandylion
11:43 < timtimmah> I was dicking about in the armory
12:48 < gradius> Oh joy. SAITS is gonna have some fun.
12:49 < gradius> EPO is misflagging all internet browsers as a virus and removing them.
12:49 < timtimmah> NICE
12:49 < gradius> Yeah, I think it was a new ruleset that was pushed out recently.
12:49 < gradius> WHO NEEDS A TEST ENVIRONMENT, WE ARE THE TEST ENVIRONMENT
12:49 < timtimmah> Dev enviroment?
12:49 < timtimmah> Nah!
12:50 < timtimmah> Do it live every time.
12:50 < gradius> EVERYTIME
12:50 < gradius> FUCK THAT THING IT CAN GET ON THE INTERNET ITS A VIRUS
12:50 < gradius> hey
12:50 < gradius> EPO just went into LOCKDOWN PARANOID mode.
12:50 < gradius> that's all
12:50 < gradius> FUCK YOU NO INTERNET
12:50 < timtimmah> ONLY IE6
12:50 < DrItanium> gradius: Excellent, enjoy your intership
12:51 < gradius> It realized that all viruses were coming froma browser, so that's what happened.
12:51 < gradius> Nuked em all.
12:51 < gradius> Including chrome + firefox.
12:51 < gradius> DrItanium: Thanks :) Still waiting for fucking Riot to get back to me with details about my pay
12:51 < gradius> b/c if Riot pays equal, I'd really like to go there.
12:51 < DrItanium> Oh I meant the EPO thing
12:51 < gradius> Oh LOL
12:51 < DrItanium> But yeah that is pretty awesome
12:52 < gradius> So yeah, now I get to pick between Mcafee and Riot :)
12:52 < gradius> WHICH ONE WILL GIVE ME MORE MONEy
12:52 < gradius> (and be more fun)
12:52 < DrItanium> Hopefully nvidia will hire me I want to work on the OCG
12:52 < gradius> (mcafee sounds like more dev work, which I dont want)
12:52 < gradius> but we'll see :)
12:52 < gradius> DrItanium: they'd be crazy not to.
12:52 < gradius> Just show them all your IA stuff.
12:53 < DrItanium> Well I did talk to the director of the OCG group. Who actually wrote the Itanium compiler when he worked at HP prior to 2011
12:53 < DrItanium> He was my interviewer
12:53 < gradius> dude
12:53 < gradius> fucking nice
12:53 < gradius> I assume you impressed him
12:53 < DrItanium> Very awesome guy, he asked me how I would write a basic block scheduler for an Itanium compiler as one of my interview questions
12:53 < DrItanium> I think so
12:54 < gradius> Looooooool.
12:54 < gradius> Fucking god tier, I swear.
12:54 < gradius> I gotta get better at low level stuff.
12:54 < DrItanium> Although I first said that I'm going to assume we have a good instruction selector
12:54 < gradius> Even just for analysis.
12:54 < DrItanium> OCG is the god tier of low level
12:54 < DrItanium> Takes in graphics and compute code and converts it to microcode the gpu can execute
12:54 < hotdogs> gradius: no, play video games instead
12:55 < DrItanium> Crap, CSS Time
12:55 < DrItanium> later
12:55 < swiss> I would go to CSS
12:55 < swiss> but I need to do my debate
12:55 < swiss> mendez: sorry :(

10:23 < timtimmah> fixed it?
10:23 < hotdogs> gradius: so I realized that it wouldn't be so dark at night if the moon was out
10:23 < gradius> Yeah.
10:23 < gradius> We were fucked last night b/c of that.
10:23 < gradius> and the whole "not having blood thing" sucked too
10:24 < timtimmah> set your gamma up?
10:24 < hotdogs> hax
10:25 < gradius> and it looked fucking bad
10:25 < hotdogs> the picture is super dark
10:25 < hotdogs> as in, very low contrast
10:25 < hotdogs> so upping gamma only helps a little
10:25 < timtimmah> fff
10:26 < timtimmah> I can't wait to play
10:26 < timtimmah> stupid social life
10:26 < hotdogs> I had to take the stairs
10:26 < hotdogs> now I feel gross
10:26 < hotdogs> http://www.calendar-365.com/moon/moon-calendar.html

10:27 < hotdogs> at least, I assume it uses the real moon cycle
10:29 < timtimmah> We need to stake a claim at fragnite
10:30 < gradius> Im assuming they do.
10:30 < gradius> Also yes, you do need to play with us timtimmah
10:30 < hotdogs> we can't play at fragnite
10:31 < gradius> Im not going to
10:31 < gradius> b/c I dont wanna bring my PC
10:31 < hotdogs> same
10:31 < hotdogs> also, it takes hours to do anything
10:31 < gradius> Playing MTG instead
10:31 < gradius> yeah
10:31 < gradius> and coordinating at fragnite = no fun
10:31 < gradius> AND
10:31 < gradius> not hearing gunshots
10:31 < gradius> would fucking suck
10:31 < timtimmah> OK THEN FINE JEEZ

10:40 < timtimmah> today's thursday?
10:40 < timtimmah> I might be able to play, i dono
10:40 < gradius> yay :)
10:40 < gradius> gradius got somewhat better at navigation
10:41 < timtimmah> can you do nav points?
10:41 < gradius> though improvement from AWFUL isn't much improvment
10:41 < _5moufl> btw, what is the channel about exactly?
10:41 < gradius> woah wtf
10:41 < gradius> hi man
10:41 < _5moufl> hi
10:41 < timtimmah> vgh
10:41 < gradius> How did you find the channel?
10:41 < _5moufl> I searched DayZ in the channels list
10:41 < gradius> lololol
10:41 < _5moufl> it was the only one
10:41 < gradius> NICE
10:42 < gradius> well at first this channel was a test channel for my irc bots
10:42 < gradius> but then myself and a bunch of friends started using it for all things that didnt fit in our main channel
10:42 < gradius> meaning if we didnt wanna spam the main IRC channel we're all in we'll talk about it here.
10:43 < gradius> We all just recently picked up DayZ, so that's why I set the topic to DayZ stuff.
10:44 < gradius> That's just funny that you found us because of DayZ
10:44 < _5moufl> Did you play ArmA before playing dayz ?
10:44 < gradius> not really, I think one of us owned the game before.
10:44 < _5moufl> I'm just reluctant to spend money but I also really wanna try DayZ :x
10:44 < gradius> But we found the mod, and all jumped in together.
10:45 < timtimmah> I've heard it described as multiplayer stalker
10:45 < gradius> DayZ is a lot of fun, we've played it for about 2 days together.
10:45 < gradius> Its a lot more fun with friends on voice chat.
10:46 < _5moufl> I need to convince people then
10:46 < gradius> Since, you'll spend a good hour looking for eachother.
10:46 < _5moufl> or play with you :°
10:46 < hotdogs> I'd be wary about recommending it to people without patience
10:46 < gradius> That works too haha.
10:46 < gradius> hotdogs: agreed.
10:47 < _5moufl> what's that main channel you were talkin' about ?
10:47 < gradius> Also, if you find a faster server your game will lag a LOT less.
10:47 < gradius> it's a channel related to our college club.
10:47 < gradius> We all go to the same school.
10:47 < gradius> But since there's like 40+ people in that channel
10:47 < gradius> we don't wanna spam it all the time with our video game chatter.
10:47 < gradius> and random shit we say.
10:48 < _5moufl> I'm glad it wasn't invite only/secret
10:48 < gradius> Yeah, I essentially registered just so I had a dedicated channel to test my bot.
10:48 < gradius> Then people stuck around to try and break my irc bot
10:49 < _5moufl> :)
10:49 < gradius> then it kinda just turned into a "whatever the fuck we want" channel
10:49 < _5moufl> with your name on it
10:49 < gradius> exactly.
10:50 < _5moufl> I just hope I'm not gonna buy it an then in 2 days STEAM SALE!
10:50 < timtimmah> If that happens, e-mail them. Usually they're nice about that
10:50 < gradius> _5moufl: yeah we were worried too. I actually tried to get a sale by emailing Gabe.
10:51 < timtimmah> gradius: ever hear back from gaben?
10:51 < gradius> timtimmah: nope :(
10:51 < gradius> he doesn't like us.
10:51 < _5moufl> gabe ?
10:51 < gradius> Gabe Newal (spelling)
10:51 < gradius> the guy who "runs"? valve
10:51 < gradius> Newell. I think.
10:52 < _5moufl> ^
10:52 < _5moufl> yep
10:52 < prometheusx> yeah, he responds to emails sometimes
10:53 < _5moufl> bbl

12:57 < hotdogs> okay
13:02 < _5moufl> The door was open zero-one. So I came in
13:12 < _5moufl> what server are you using btw?
13:15 < gradius> For DayZ? We just jump on whichever one isn't slow at the time.
13:15 < _5moufl> ok
13:15 < DrItanium> http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HeroicBSOD
13:15 < _5moufl> how many player per server ?
13:16 < gradius> _5moufl: It's depending on the server, some have 50 spaces, some 30
13:16 < gradius> and other numbers as well.
13:16 < gradius> Most common is 50.
13:16 < _5moufl> I thought it was more than that
13:17 < _5moufl> Not sure I understand the "persistency" of the game since you can connect on a different server each time you play
13:17 < gradius> Ah well the way it works is
13:17 < gradius> Every DayZ server connects to a central database
13:17 < gradius> and pulls down the charcter data.
13:18 < gradius> So it has your position/inventory
13:18 < gradius> but things like vehicle and tent locations are serverbound
13:18 < gradius> Thats why if the main database is laggy, it doesnt matter what server you connect to, they're all goign to take the same time to log in
13:18 < _5moufl> how long does it take to go from one "edge" to the other? (quite a lot I assume)
13:19 < _5moufl> 225km²
13:20 < _5moufl> meaning 15km-sides
13:20 < _5moufl> ~1hr if you run :o
13:20 < DrItanium> well...taking an average walking speed of the speed of light, I would say less than second
13:21 < gradius> lol DrItanium
13:21 < _5moufl> :P
13:21 < gradius> but _5moufl I'm not really sure, I've done a decent amount of walking
13:21 < gradius> and it does take some patience
13:21 < gradius> especially if you're trying to be quiet and not attract attention
13:21 < _5moufl> assuming you don't die trying to reach one edge
13:22 < _5moufl> which apparently happens a LOT
13:22 < _5moufl> You asked about mine but in which timezone are you?
13:24 < prometheusx> gradius: could you potentially set up your own dayz server with a db?
13:25 < gradius> _5moufl: we're all from California
13:25 < gradius> Pacific time.
13:25 < gradius> prometheusx: I dont know if they release the db code.
13:25 < prometheusx> weak!
13:25 < gradius> I DONT KNOW
13:25 < gradius> They could and I could just not know.
13:25 < gradius> Google it.
13:25 < _5moufl> -9hrs compared to me iirc
13:26 < prometheusx> you are the all knowing gradius!
13:26 < _5moufl> ^ even I know that
13:26 < prometheusx> _5moufl: so it's about 1030 where you're at?
13:26 < _5moufl> indeed

15:31 < gradius> lolol
15:32 < gradius> that's fine with me
15:32 < DrItanium> NO! That's a really bad coding practice....
15:32 < DrItanium> Simple core with plugins is what you should be striving for
15:32 < DrItanium> One of the plugins is the help module
15:32 < DrItanium> Alan Kay the program
15:35 < DrItanium> It always helps to separate arguments by commas :/
15:35 < hotdogs> overengineering is the best
15:35 < DrItanium> hotdogs: Or a way to make the core program really simple and easily fixable
15:35 < gradius> DrItanium: I guess I could include a help module.
15:36 < gradius> I was just lazy :P
15:36 < DrItanium> But since it's a module you can build it as you go
15:36 < DrItanium> Or have each module provide a portion of the help (if you go that route)
15:38 < hotdogs> DrItanium: trying to keep the core program really simple and easily fixable assumes all of the functionality you add will be more complex than the structure managing the modules
15:38 < hotdogs> if you make a bot that never does anything more complicated, then, well, you done overengineered
15:39 < hotdogs> making a program that can reload modules on the fly is neat, but I'd do that separate from the irc bot
15:40 < DrItanium> hotdogs: I'm not talking about reloading on the fly. I'm talking about making the core of the code be separate from the functionality
15:42 < DrItanium> w00t I cut down the running time of the knowledge engineering module for my compiler pass from 44 seconds to 1.2 seconds

16:41 < _5moufl> slow ping or slow... ?
16:42 < gradius> both really, we noticed tht if we connected to a server with high ping it made our game overall laggy too

22:43 < zero-one> i'm trying to get my mother's computer to run LoL
22:43 < zero-one> patching at the moment
22:43 < zero-one> we'll see how it runs
22:43 < hotdogs> lol
22:44 < zero-one> *30 minutes later*
22:44 < zero-one> i'm trying to get my toaster to run LoL
22:45 < zero-one> big question here is: why am i only getting 7KBps for this patch?
22:46 < zero-one> lol, uninstalled Pando and it jumped to 200
22:46 < zero-one> scumbag Riot
22:47 < zero-one> now 300
22:47 < zero-one> gradius: as soon as you get there, you need to do something about Pando

00:24 < gradius> zero-one: Uninstall it :|
00:24 < gradius> oh you did.
00:24 < gradius> Pando sucks balls, but it helps keep load off the riot servers.
00:24 < gradius> So I understand their logic
00:24 < zero-one> fuck that
00:26 < gradius> QQ moar when you have as large a player base as Riot.
00:36 < zero-one> not every player is downloading at the same time
00:36 < zero-one> from a business perspective though...
00:37 < zero-one> i would probably do it the same way -_-
00:37 < hotdogs> pando might offer to host some of the downloaderin' or moneys or something
00:37 < hotdogs> so they get bundled

12:49 < airen> swiss: Speaking of hot air, we still have yet to get ramen.
12:49 < swiss> true
12:49 < swiss> after insurance gets figured out :(
12:49 < airen> Yeah.
12:50 < airen> Summer time is probably better for you anyway.
12:50 < swiss> well, I can go as soon as I know that the tiny bit of cash I have isn't going to be the ONLY cash I have to repair my car
12:50 < swiss> cause I'm living off like $50 till insurance pays up
12:50 < airen> jah jah jah

18:57 < hotdogs> I'm a bit inland, too
18:58 < prometheusx> hotdogs: we should watch this movie http://i.imgur.com/xeGIi.jpg
19:28 < hotdogs> we should live that movie
19:59 < hotdogs> also I made my dayz performance super smooth by adding -cpucount and -maxmem
20:00 < zero-one> what do those options do?
20:00 < hotdogs> sets the max cpus/memory to use
20:00 < hotdogs> apparently it chooses wrong by default? dunno
20:02 < zero-one> oh
20:02 < zero-one> well shit
20:02 < zero-one> lemme try that real quick
20:17 < hotdogs> lol
20:18 < hotdogs> I logged in outside of a camp I looted and found like 4 dudes looting it
20:18 < hotdogs> got one to blood pack me, that was nerve-racking though
20:18 < hotdogs> stepping out into a group of four people pointing guns at you cause you got nowhere else to go
20:31 < zero-one> hotdogs: got it running pretty smooth, but there's still some input lag
22:03 < swiss> LoL?

14:09 < hotdogs> s
14:09 < hotdogs> when
14:09 < hotdogs>  :(
14:10 < gradius> TONIGHT
14:10 < gradius> WE PLAY GAEMZ
14:10 < gradius> hotdogs: what would you like to play?
14:10 < zero-one> TONIGHT
14:10 < zero-one> YOU
14:10 < gradius> DayZ?
14:10 < gradius> Or LoL?
14:10 < zero-one> gradius: who says we can't do both?
14:11 < gradius> My 9800.
14:11 < zero-one> 9800?
14:11 < gradius> NVidia 9800gtx
14:11 < hotdogs> you need to add the cpucount option bro
14:11 < hotdogs> then you'll be fine
14:12 < gradius> hotdogs: what do you mean? I'm unfamilar with that.
14:12 < zero-one> yeah, it's great
14:12 < zero-one> once you add those options, DayZ becomes your bitch
14:13 < hotdogs> there's command line options that make it run a lot better
14:13 < hotdogs> yesterday I played for an hour and it was really shitty so I added those options and now it's smooth everywhere
14:14 < hotdogs> also, I've played a bunch...so I've moved past the "bean wars"
14:14 < hotdogs> so I think it's time to start murdering other players
14:14 < gradius> holy shit.
14:14 < gradius> nice man
14:14 < hotdogs> fun fact: if you only ever communicate with people through direct comm (the proximity stuff), people never see your name
14:14 < gradius> so literally just a -cpucount to the launch options?
14:15 < hotdogs> I was SO close to murdering people and claiming to be someone else
14:15 < gradius> haha
14:15 < hotdogs> no, google it
14:15 < gradius> kk
14:15 < hotdogs> there's a memory one too
14:15 < gradius> I have a core2 duo.
14:15 < gradius> Still okay? :(
14:15 < gradius> Fucking PC needs an upgrade bad.
14:15 < hotdogs> people were talking in side-comm about some guy who needed one of those morphine pens
14:16 < hotdogs> and some people were going to him, I really wanted to go to him and kill him, to frame the other people
14:16 < hotdogs> also "OMG I HAERD SHOTS, FRIENDLY?"
14:16 < gradius> hahahaha
14:16 < gradius> nice man
14:16 < gradius> Im jelly
14:16 < gradius> but we'll play tonight for sure
14:16 < gradius> so cpuCount=2 will get it to use both cpus?
14:17 < gradius> also, checking the memory one to force more ram
14:17 < hotdogs> "WHO IS LOOTING THE DEER STANDS?"
14:18 < hotdogs> fuck you, I'm not going to tell you I'm looting them
14:18 < gradius> hahahahaha
14:18 < hotdogs> also, I have a hatchet now
14:18 < gradius> Why would someone ask that?
14:18 < hotdogs> so I want to go around the forests starting campfires
14:18 < hotdogs> to freak the fuck out of people
14:18 < gradius> lol you're way into it now
14:18 < hotdogs> also, this one time I was running at a goat to kill it (when their meat is cooked they give 800 health so they're awesome) and two jerks got chased by zombies across my path
14:18 < gradius> I gotta get back on
14:19 < gradius> also, you could help me navigate better now.
14:19 < hotdogs> I jumped in the grass and watched them loot a deer stand and start a fire and kill my goat
14:19 < gradius> :(
14:19 < gradius> wow.... lamenesss
14:19 < hotdogs> I was tempted to kill them, but I only had an mp5
14:19 < hotdogs> also, I may or may not have been not killedb y them earlier
14:19 < hotdogs> I had 155 health
14:19 < hotdogs> er, blood
14:19 < hotdogs> so I walked out on a bunch of friendlies and one of them blood packed me
14:19 < hotdogs> scary as fuck
14:20 < gradius> wow :(
14:20 < hotdogs> and I really wanted to waste them all, but I needed healing
14:20 < gradius> chancing it there.
14:20 < gradius> lol yeah
14:20 < hotdogs> also, I found a coyote backpack but didn't realize the newbie backpack isn't a coyote backpack :(
14:20 < hotdogs> so right now I have an ALICE, 20 slots.  coyote is 24
14:20 < hotdogs> I went on voice
14:20 < hotdogs> "hey you guys, if I step out will you shoot me"
14:21 < gradius> dat social engineering?
14:21 < hotdogs> the zombies are nothing, man
14:21 < hotdogs> it's a pvp arma2 simulator
14:22 < hotdogs> I really hope they fix vehicle spawning at some point
14:22 < gradius> Oh yeah, once you get to a point where you can deal with the zombies, it's all about surviving the players
14:23 < gradius> I'd like to get us a car :P
14:23 < hotdogs> and once you can survive the players, it's all about murdering the players
14:23 < zero-one> gradius: good luck
14:23 < gradius> and a solid base point, have you found a nice one?
14:23 < gradius> hotdogs: we should just camp out at Rok
14:23 < hotdogs> I need a tent before I can even consider making a camp
14:23 < gradius> (or whatever it's called)
14:23 < hotdogs> rog?
14:23 < zero-one> we can make the castle ours
14:23 < hotdogs> I found another castle
14:23 < gradius> yeah
14:23 < gradius> niiiice.
14:23 < gradius> I'm excited to play tonight.
14:23 < hotdogs> rog is probably a bad one
14:23 < gradius> ah
14:23 < hotdogs> too close to the coast
14:24 < gradius> gotcha.
14:24 < hotdogs> but also, it's a pain in the dick to hill climb
14:24 < hotdogs> and it's on the map, that's a bad place for a camp
14:24 < hotdogs> oh, and I ran into a dude who was like "okay are you friendly? cause I've got a sniper"
14:24 < hotdogs> that was neat
14:24 < hotdogs> I was emoting at him
14:25 < gradius> haha
14:25 < gradius> so he was just like
14:25 < gradius> If you aren't friendly Im gonna snipe your ass?
14:26 < hotdogs> yes
14:26 < gradius> sweet
14:26 < hotdogs> a MAD sort of situation
14:26 < gradius> how long have you been alive so far?
14:27 < hotdogs> honestly, telling me you have a sniper makes me want to try to kill you
14:27 < gradius> same life as the first time I met with you
14:27 < gradius> lol yeah
14:27 < gradius> really
14:27 < hotdogs> uhh, still on my life from rog
14:27 < hotdogs> after that night I logged in outside cherno
14:27 < gradius> ahhhh
14:28 < gradius> I remember that
14:28 < hotdogs> grabbed some more shit from the medic camp in cherno then started going NW
14:28 < hotdogs> there wasn't much in the towns along the way...I can probably tell you which ones actually have enterable buildings if I had a map
14:29 < hotdogs> by stary sobor/novy sobor have some sweet stuff
14:29 < hotdogs> there's a military camp there
14:29 < hotdogs> that's where I got my blood transfusion
14:30 < hotdogs> I got down to 155 health in that place and swapped my CZ550 scoped rifle for the mp5, cause I was out of makarov ammo
14:30 < hotdogs> then found a PDW...
14:30 < hotdogs> also, the GPS spits out numbers instead of showing you on the map, lololololo
14:31 < hotdogs> also, I found a camo skin in the novy sobor church
14:31 < hotdogs> so I look different from pretty much everyone I run into
14:32 < hotdogs> there's no hat, though...
14:32 < gradius> aww boo
14:32 < gradius> but nice.
14:32 < gradius> and lol how do you use the GPS then?
14:33 < hotdogs> it gives you your grid coordinates
14:33 < hotdogs> that are listed on the left/top side of the screen on the map
14:34 < hotdogs> so it might be useful if I was drugged and kidnapped, or had a car...
14:34 < hotdogs> when you're running across the map, though, it's hard to lose track of yourself.  Unless you're gradius
14:34 < gradius> ahhh
14:34 < gradius> :(
14:34 < gradius> also yes
14:34 < gradius> if you're gradius
14:34 < gradius> fuck me, right?
14:35 < gradius> I get off work at 4, :)
14:35 < hotdogs> if(gradius) { fuck(gradius) }

10:29 < promethuesx> ]beat hl2 though, bought the episodes in the sale, haven't played them
10:30 < timtimmah> promethuesx: I blame the achivements
10:30 < timtimmah> <-- slight perfectionist tendacies

00:56 < swiss> ready when yo uare
10:46 < gradius> airen: your gf is a linguistics major?
10:46 < gradius> I forget.
10:46 < gradius> Because I'm reading through the wiki page on tilde and holy fuck mind explode.
10:46 < gradius> That's so much info.
10:46 < gradius> Languages are fucking weird.
10:49 < airen> gradius: Yes, she's in the doctorate program at UCLA for Linguistics.
10:50 < gradius> jesus fuck :|
10:50 < gradius> that scares me lol
10:50 < gradius> also
10:50 < gradius> wtf jugglign notation
10:50 < gradius> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling_notation
10:51 < gradius> I would love to know more about linguistics, especially in application to natural language processing.
10:51 < gradius> But, I don't think I could figure it out, and I don't have much use for it, other than tinkering.
10:53 < promethuesx> gradius: you could do what the dc949 guys did!
10:54 < hotdogs> gradius: FORMAL LANGUAGES AREN'T WEIRD.
10:54 < gradius> hotdogs: That's true, but spoken languages are fucked up
10:54 < hotdogs> yes
11:29 < gradius> NICE EMAIL HOTDOGS
11:29 < timtimmah> gradius: I realized
11:29 < timtimmah> I never got the final exam back
11:29 < timtimmah> becaues it was the final.
11:30 < hotdogs> you like my email
11:31 < hotdogs> gradius: omg don't let haven play dayz
11:31 < hotdogs> DON'T LET HER INVADE OUR SPECIAL PLACE
11:32 < gradius> LOL
11:32 < gradius> I dont think she really is that interested.
11:32 < gradius> Personally, I dont think it's a good idea she plays anyway.
11:32 < gradius> Perma death has never been her thing.
11:32 < gradius> I think if anything she'd just be interested in watching me play.
11:33 < gradius> Damn, I gotta go and get the right cert. Maybe I'll do that tonight.
11:33 < gradius> So much I wanna do tonight :(
11:33 < hotdogs> also
11:33 < hotdogs> brb shitting on your forums
11:33 < gradius> hotdogs: fine with me :)
11:33 < gradius> To be honest even random posts get people talking
11:33 < gradius> which is good.
11:34 < gradius> I just want people to remember it exists, sometimes even I forget to check for a few days.
11:35 < gradius> airen: RARLYS ON I SHOULD SPAM HIM FOR JORBS
11:35 < gradius> lol :P
11:36 < gradius> On another note entirely, I think taking a class with Dr. Liu may have fucked up my graduation.
11:36 < gradius> I need that elective credit to graduate, but I think he's okay with failing 60% of the class.
11:38 < hotdogs> can you edit posts?
11:39 < hotdogs> oh there
11:42 < gradius> yup
11:42 < gradius> fucking LOL
11:42 < gradius> at your suggestion
11:44 < hotdogs> it's too bad you can't see prior edits

12:25 < gradius> we'll have to look tonight, though I wont be home till later
12:33 < gradius> apparently you can mark the map too. Time to look into that.
12:40 < gradius> I think we just gotta start moving into other towns more, maybe finding more areas to loot. We're searching for bigger time items now and ammo.
12:48 < gradius> also apparently the lee enfield is super loud http://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/uf741/one_shot_of_the_lee_enfield/

18:17 < hotdogs> BUT WILL YOU?
18:17 < hotdogs> are you done with finals
18:22 < hotdogs> besides, even if you do play you are off in the land of miracles and military camps
18:24 < zero-one> I can't play tonight since i get off so late
18:24 < gradius> lol
18:24 < gradius> well I can make it twoards you guys
18:37 < hotdogs> that doesn't work until we can consistently stay alive
18:40 < hotdogs> gradius: also we neglected the always chicago rule
18:42 < timtimmah> ?
18:42 < hotdogs> the chicago servers restart every 6 hours
18:43 < hotdogs> in 1.6 they were noticably better
18:43 < hotdogs> not sure about 1.7
18:43 < hotdogs> 1.7 might just be a huge pile in general
18:45 < timtimmah> ah okay
18:58 < timtimmah> test dicks test
18:59 < timtimmah> nevermind ignore me.
19:17 < hotdogs> I can't get dayz working with the beta patch
19:18 < gradius> No, you do not say things luike that
19:18 < gradius> I REFUSE TO WORK TO PLAY MY GAMEZX
19:19 < hotdogs> I'll tell you what to do when I figure it out
19:20 < gradius> okay :)
19:20 < gradius> I'll check it out too
19:20 < hotdogs> damn steam
19:23 < hotdogs> the gross way is to copy the beta patch in place over the original...lol
19:28 < hotdogs> I CAN'T DO IT
19:28 < hotdogs> I DON'T GET IT
19:29 < hotdogs> fuck this
19:29 < hotdogs> I hate windows shit
19:29 < hotdogs> the internet is always "hey gayz i made a tool download this exe http://blahblah.ru/fuckingvirus.exe"
19:30 < hotdogs> I DON'T WANT YOUR BULLSHIT
19:30 < hotdogs> I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID
19:30 < hotdogs> SO I CAN DO IT
19:30 < hotdogs> FUCKER
19:32 < hotdogs> fuckers
19:32 < hotdogs> THEY'RE ALL SAYING "DUDE USE A LAUNCHER"
19:32 < hotdogs> NO, FUCK YOU
19:37 < hotdogs> got it
19:37 < gradius> where are you getting an error?
19:37 < gradius> with all the servers that say beta requried?
19:38 < gradius> b/c I cant even get on the ones that dont have that.
19:38 < gradius> There are servers that say they have 1.7, but when I connect it complains
19:38 < gradius> saying I have 1.7 and they have 1.6
19:38 < hotdogs> dunno
19:38 < hotdogs> did you update recently? 1.7.0 was released
19:40 < hotdogs> but yeah I figured I'd try out 1.7.0 and the beta arma2 patch
19:41 < gradius> i did patch to 1.7
19:41 < gradius> should I do the beta too?
19:41 < gradius> Im assuming youre going to be playing on those servers
19:41 < hotdogs> yeah
19:41 < hotdogs> there's an LA one now
19:41 < hotdogs> LA 3
19:41 < hotdogs> aww yeah
19:41 < gradius> i saww that
19:41 < gradius> nice
19:41 < gradius> k so how do you do the beta
19:41 < gradius> lol
19:42 < hotdogs> download the installer, then copy paste the shortcut from the arma 2 OA dir to your desktop or wherever
19:42 < hotdogs> then change it to add: "-mod=C:\wherever arma 2 is;EXPANSION;ca;@dayz"
19:42 < hotdogs> NOTE: ARMA 2
19:42 < hotdogs> NOT ARMA 2 OA
19:44 < gradius> wheres the arma 2 beta
19:44 < gradius> i can only find oa
19:45 < hotdogs> lol
19:45 < hotdogs> spawned by kamenka
19:45 < hotdogs> fuck it, suicide
19:45 < gradius> hahaha
19:46 < hotdogs> also, cpucount/memmax might not be necessary
19:46 < hotdogs> dunno
19:46 < gradius> yah
19:46 < gradius> i think that's true
19:46 < gradius> but
19:46 < gradius> where get arma2 beta
19:49 < hotdogs> r/dayz see sidebar
19:50 < gradius> all I see is arma2 OA beta
19:51 < hotdogs> correct
19:51 < hotdogs> that is what you want
19:51 < hotdogs> we're playing combined arms technically
19:51 < hotdogs> which is OA using shit from arma2 or something
19:51 < gradius> ohhhhhhhh
19:51 < gradius> Sorry I misread your comment above
19:51 < hotdogs> when you add -mod
19:51 < gradius> I thought you were saying get arma2 beta
19:51 < gradius> yah
19:52 < hotdogs> the path has to be to steam/common/arma 2/
19:52 < hotdogs> not arma 2 oa/
19:55 < gradius> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9isjtzE2iUA
19:56 < gradius> running installer now
19:57 < prometheusx> im getting 500 errors from youtube :/
20:00 < hotdogs> good news, I found a 1911 and a mag for it
20:00 < hotdogs> bad news, I destroyed it by trying to put it in my bag
20:00 < gradius> :(
20:01 < hotdogs> only had 1 mag, who cares
20:02 < gradius> for the arma2 dir
20:02 < gradius> do I need quotes?
20:02 < gradius> around it?
20:02 < hotdogs> are there spaces?
20:02 < gradius> yes.3
20:02 < hotdogs> if so, put quotes around the argument
20:02 < gradius> yes*
20:02 < gradius> kk
20:02 < hotdogs> this is shell stuff, c'mon!
20:02 < gradius> No I figured it was yes
20:02 < gradius> But I wasn't sure and I didnt wanna fight it
20:03 < gradius> la3?
20:03 < hotdogs> yes
20:03 < hotdogs> mumble?
20:03 < hotdogs> I looted rog but didn't get much more than binos
20:03 < hotdogs> where to now
20:03 < hotdogs> sobors?
20:04 < hotdogs> lolo
20:04 < gradius> shit man
20:04 < gradius> LA servers full
20:04 < gradius> ill keep trying
20:04 < hotdogs> alright
20:04 < gradius> all 3 of them are full
20:04 < gradius> but Ill keep at it
20:04 < hotdogs> I'm gonna og through mogilevka
20:05 < hotdogs> I will let you know if someone leaves
20:05 < gradius> tesging in LA2 first
20:05 < gradius> then I;ll get on mumble
20:05 < gradius> then get for 3
20:06 < hotdogs> I can change if you find one with room
20:07 < hotdogs> it's a little disturbing how quickly this game has taught me to navigate directions using topo lines
20:07 < timtimmah> hotdogs: quick, find the gradiant vectors
20:17 < hotdogs> never!
20:18 < zero-one> hotdogs: quick, find the gradius vectors
20:21 < prometheusx> gradius: quick, find the hotdogs vectors
20:21 < hotdogs> what's your vector victor
20:22 < timtimmah> Do we have clerance, Clarance?
20:22 < chrislz> Roger, Roger.
20:28 < prometheusx> gradius: ok, i want to play dayZ after watching that video
20:34 < swiss> woo, made a recording that only mostly sucks of "How to save a life"
20:34 < swiss> after sucking for the rest of the night on other songs
20:46 < gradius> prometheusx: you should :)
20:48 < prometheusx> after my finals!
20:48 < prometheusx> even though im not studying for my final tomorrow
20:48 < timtimmah> prometheusx: probably should
20:49 < timtimmah> unless it's a com class
20:50 < prometheusx> cis 310! complete bullshit, but our test has to be completely written out
20:50 < timtimmah> hate that
20:50 < timtimmah> I heard you like hand cramps
20:52 < prometheusx> even since i've had a computer i barely write anymore and the cramps come easier
20:55 < hotdogs> masturbate like you're using a pen
20:59 < prometheusx> i don't even
21:32 < hotdogs> just do it
22:08 < chrislz> hotdogs: swiss: zero-one: LoL
22:08 < swiss> chrislz: nope, i'm anime-ing
22:21 < gradius> chrislz: lol?
22:37 < gradius> prometheusx: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=pGH-BjEc4jM
22:37 < gradius> more dayz videos :)
22:40 < prometheusx> gradius: i should be studying!
22:42 < prometheusx> but im not, cause i don't care!
23:44 < gradius> prometheusx: just got prompted for an upgrade
23:44 < gradius> finally
23:44 < gradius> on my phone
23:53 < prometheusx> haha, i need to see how to keep root on mine and update
--- Day changed Tue Jun 05 2012
00:08 < gradius> task switcher seems to be speedier.
00:08 < gradius> not ad.
00:08 < gradius> bad*
08:25 < alexjandro> stupid fucking new people
08:25 < alexjandro> sit in my cube and take it over
09:50 < prometheusx> have them sit *ON* your cube next time
09:54 < alexjandro> no
09:54 < alexjandro> wat
10:38 < hotdogs> that's why you should leave shit all over the desk
10:42 < timtimmah> alexjandro: tell them they're in your office
10:42 < timtimmah> and to piss off
10:44 < hotdogs> and call them a wanker
10:44 < hotdogs> or a bellend
10:46 < prometheusx> call them a cunt
10:57 < zero-one> alexjandro: just flash your gun, it works every time
11:04 < timtimmah> alexjandro: your twin cannons of brimstone
11:05 < alexjandro> i should just piss on the desk
11:07 < prometheusx> eat asparagus first
11:20 < alexjandro> i'll eat assparagus
11:25 < swiss> alexjandro: http://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/ulrqy/im_an_18yearold_female_looking_for_a_prom_date/
11:27 < prometheusx> alexjandro: totally do it
11:31 < gradius> I want to play DayZ :(
11:31 < gradius> Tonight at like 11ish? maybe 10:30 but I cant make promises.
11:31 < timtimmah> gradius: HOLY SHIT I CAN FUCKING PLAY TODAY
11:31 < timtimmah> DEAR GOD YES
11:31 < gradius> OMG
11:31 < gradius> YOU CAN COME TO OUR DAYZ TUESDAYS
11:32 < timtimmah> FUCK YEAH
11:32 < gradius> You've played before?
11:32 < gradius> I forget.
11:32 < timtimmah> :(
11:32 < timtimmah> No
11:32 < gradius> Oh okay :)
11:32 < timtimmah> I'll probably dick around a bit while you guys do stuff
11:32 < timtimmah> then I'll join up
11:32 < gradius> hotdogs will learn you the ways of navigation.
11:32 < gradius> Trust me, I was fucking lost for a LONG time
11:32 < gradius> before I grouped up with hotdogs and he taught me how to nav
11:33 < alexjandro> swiss: i saw that
11:33 < gradius> timtimmah: it's a sweet fucking game.
11:34 < gradius> I'm shockingly on like day 5 or so of my life.
11:34 < timtimmah> I've played a bit of arma2
11:34 < gradius> Somehow.
11:34 < timtimmah> but not dayz
11:34 < gradius> Well that's good, at least you understand the underlying mechanics
11:34 < timtimmah> Exactly
11:34 < gradius> Arma threw me for a loop for a while.
11:34 < gradius> Then I just did the boot camp.
11:34 < gradius> Made life a bit better.
11:34 < timtimmah> Oh yeah, bootcamp is superhelpful
11:35 < gradius> Should redo it again sometime.
11:35 < timtimmah> I don't think I need much beyond training
11:35 < timtimmah> vehicles not so much
11:35 < gradius> Esp now that I have a red dot assault rifle.
11:35 < gradius> Haven't used it yet in game LOL
11:35 < gradius> got it like 2 days ago.
11:35 < timtimmah> nice
11:36 < gradius> Yeah, we gotta hit up some grocery stores.
11:36 < gradius> And see if we can find tents.
11:36 < gradius> Oh
11:36 < gradius> They also started 4 LA servers./
11:36 < gradius> Minimal lag.
11:36 < gradius> :)
11:36 < timtimmah> oh sweet
11:36 < timtimmah> but always night
11:37 < gradius> Nah one of them is offset by a few.
11:37 < gradius> It wasn't too bad.
11:37 < gradius> And I'm not sure if they're all that way.
11:38 < zero-one> oh man
11:38 < zero-one> finally
11:38 < zero-one> an LA server
11:38 < prometheusx> you should get night vision goggles
11:40 < timtimmah> I have to play first :X
11:40 < timtimmah> TONIGHT
11:40 < timtimmah> I WILL BE TRASHED AND PLAYING DAYZ
11:40 < prometheusx> you sound like a danger to others
11:41 < timtimmah> just don't give me a gun, only a flashlight
11:41 < timtimmah> I can be the zbate
11:41 < timtimmah> bait*
11:45 < zero-one> lolol
11:53 < gradius> this is a very bad idea
11:53 < gradius> haha
11:56 < prometheusx> gradius: it'll be like that video, he'll use the flashlight to blind him
11:56 < timtimmah> prometheusx: what I was thinking
11:57 < zero-one> legend has it that if you look at timtimmah's dick you turn to stone
11:57 < zero-one> timtimmah: you should just do that instead of using the flashlight
11:58 < timtimmah> I like this legend
11:58 < timtimmah> "Hey, wanna get stoned?"
11:58 < zero-one> lolol
11:58 < zero-one> "DON'T LOOK THE SERPENT IN THE EYE"
12:00 < prometheusx> timtimmah: are your pubes snakes?
12:00 < timtimmah> prometheusx: they are black mambas
12:03 < prometheusx> so poisonous
12:03 < timtimmah> thick and black
12:03 < prometheusx> carpet doesn't match the drapes then
12:04 < timtimmah> I've got hardwood floors
12:13 < airen> lold
12:14 < swiss> ffffffff so much math work
12:29 < swiss> zero-one: DO YOU HAVE A FINAL TODAY?
12:29 < swiss> WANT TO TEACH ME MATH?
12:29 < prometheusx> that's why you go to class
12:34 < swiss> prometheusx: QQ
12:34 < swiss> well, i don't get this... at all really
12:34 < swiss> And I showed up for class!
12:34 < swiss> (once)
12:52 < alexjandro> swiss: i thought you were learning math on Sunday
12:52 < swiss> alexjandro: yeah.... i ended up watching anime
12:52 < swiss> and sleeeping
13:11 < alexjandro> swiss: fail
13:15 < swiss> also, i ask people in the dorms
13:15 < swiss> they say "What section?"
13:15 < swiss> "series"
13:15 < swiss> "Oh, fuck that"
13:15 < prometheusx> aliso house doesn't sound like the best place to get help with math homework
13:16 < timtimmah> it isn't
13:16 < timtimmah> i used to live there
13:17 < prometheusx> and turned out perfe... okay
13:18 < timtimmah> I turned out, that's good enough.
13:20 < alexjandro> yes]
13:24 < prometheusx> alexjandro: so did you pm that asian girl who needs a date for prom?
13:32 < alexjandro> oh no
13:33 < prometheusx> dooooo eeeet!
13:42 < swiss> it's this saturday :P
13:46 < hotdogs> do it anyway
13:46 < alexjandro> Who cares what day it is
13:48 < prometheusx> cause you're taking her to prom and it's this saturday!
13:56 < alexjandro> oh man i should get ready
14:01 < prometheusx> totally
14:50 < gradius> MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. OOO.

14:53 < swiss> gradius: do my math for me
14:53 < gradius> nope
14:53 < swiss> please?
14:53 < prometheusx> gradius: is uptime channel dependent?
14:53 < airen> !downtime
14:53 < prometheusx> !godownonmetime
14:53 < airen> !quit
14:54 < airen> !exit
14:54 < prometheusx> !balls
14:55 < gradius> prometheusx: nah it's just fucked up and time rolls over after 24 hours.
14:55 < gradius> idk why
14:56 < prometheusx> maybe add a days variable?
14:58 < hotdogs> gradius: hi
14:58 < gradius> you know, that's likely what it is
14:58 < gradius> hotdogs: hey
14:58 < hotdogs> wait
14:58 < hotdogs> how are you storing time
14:58 < gradius> where are we going tonight?
14:58 < gradius> we need to go get tents.
14:58 < hotdogs> grocery store
14:59 < prometheusx> i want to play dayZ!
14:59 < hotdogs> says the internet
14:59 < gradius> yes, but where?
14:59 < hotdogs> prometheusx: no you don't
14:59 < gradius> Which place has stores that isn't a pain in the ass?
14:59 < hotdogs> the only grocery store I know of is in stary
14:59 < gradius> ah
14:59 < hotdogs> I could use some gear too
14:59 < gradius> k
14:59 < gradius> yeah
14:59 < gradius> stary isn't a bad idea
14:59 < hotdogs> I forget where we are
14:59 < prometheusx> hotdogs: why not? :9
14:59 < gradius> close to where we're at
14:59 < hotdogs> I don't think it's that easy to go to mogilevka
14:59 < gradius> near guglovo
14:59 < hotdogs> for some reason I really like it there, easy bunch of spawns i guess
15:00 < hotdogs> novy might be good
15:00 < gradius> yeah mogilevka had some nice stuff last time.
15:00 < gradius> But yeah Novy+Stary
15:00 < hotdogs> I don't know where any other grocery stores are
15:00 < gradius> Likely in Cherno+Elektro?
15:00 < hotdogs> I don't think I've seen any but I usually don't go to the larger towns
15:00 < gradius> Yah fuck going in there.
15:00 < hotdogs> probably
15:00 < gradius> Not even worth it.
15:00 < hotdogs> even when I spent a bunch of time in cherno I never saw a grocery store
15:00 < gradius> With the amount of people, idk why everyone wants to go there.
15:01 < hotdogs> I assume I just didn't go to the right area
15:01 < gradius> people to loot ratio :(
15:01 < gradius> also risk vs reward.
15:01 < hotdogs> because the people don't have high power rifles
15:01 < hotdogs> so you don't die randomly
15:01 < hotdogs> I guess I have been gunned down at range before in cherno
15:02 < hotdogs> but statistically I die more often in mogilevka
15:02 < prometheusx> im going to play dayz just to hunt hotdogs
15:02 < hotdogs> good luck
15:02 < hotdogs> there are 50 person servers so we have to be on the same one and playing at the same time
15:05 < gradius> prometheusx: its hard enough to find eachother when we're TRYING
15:05 < prometheusx> i just want to go zombie hunting with you guys!
15:05 < gradius> hotdogs: I've only been in mogi once... maybe I got lucky.
15:05 < gradius> prometheusx: In all honesty, if you have the PC to play it (which isn't too much), and you have the money
15:06 < gradius> I've gotten my 30 dollars worth of enjoyment from this game already.
15:06 < prometheusx> i think my laptop can handle it
15:06 < gradius> What's your graphics card on it?
15:06 < gradius> I'm not too bad on a good server w/ my 9800gt
15:09 < prometheusx> nvidia 3100m
15:09 < hotdogs> I have trouble recommending it due to the time and patience requirements
15:10 < prometheusx> IT'S SUMMER!
15:10 < hotdogs> get to work
15:11 < alexjandro> prometheusx: you done bro
15:11 < prometheusx> alexjandro: java final on thursday
15:14 < gradius> Yeah, if you can work past the initial "WTF IS THIS GAME WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE SO COMPLICATED" step
15:14 < gradius> and then get used to perma death, and dying when you get good gar.
15:14 < gradius> gear*
15:14 < gradius> and dying from stupid mistakes.
15:14 < gradius> (like falling down two flights fo stairs)
15:15 < gradius> and having to run for another 30 min to meet up with the group again
15:15 < gradius> ONCE YOU GET PAST ALL THAT
15:15 < gradius> the game is awesome
15:15 -!- sunrise [~someone@unaffiliated/sunrisewolf] has joined #testgradius
15:15 < prometheusx> WHY ARE YOU BACK!
15:16 < gradius> Because we missed her.
15:16 < prometheusx> gradius: valid point
15:16 < prometheusx> and the game seems interesting, i feel like playing something but not any of the games i already have
15:17 < sunrise> aww, you guys missed me<3
15:17 < gradius> prometheusx: Yeah, I have so many 360 games + PC games
15:17 < hotdogs> I didn't
15:17 < gradius> like I played Armored Core 5 for like 3 weeks
15:17 < gradius> then
15:17 < gradius> stopped
15:17 < hotdogs> we should play regular arma2
15:17 < prometheusx> hotdogs: would you miss me?
15:17 < hotdogs> no

15:56 < prometheusx> i think that's what he's doing
15:56 < hotdogs> was he just not printing days?

16:03 < DrItanium> yup
16:04 < DrItanium> give girldius some sensodyne, that should fix the error
16:05 < gradius> prometheusx: sorry, it's very basic atm :P
16:05 < prometheusx> you still need to add smiley to the list!
16:05 < DrItanium> And the ability to load .NET code modules

16:07 < DrItanium> Looks really nice
16:07 < DrItanium> gradius: Can I keep testing girldius?
16:07 < gradius> DrItanium: fine by me
16:07 < gradius> you know where the source is?
16:07 < DrItanium> gradius: I was more thinking just attempting to break it through input
16:08 < prometheusx> it's supposed to be a balrog
16:08 < gradius> That's what I mean.
16:08 < DrItanium> I don't like python actually
16:08 < DrItanium> but I do know that girldius is on your github account
16:08 < gradius> It should be doing a decent sanity check on most input
16:08 < gradius> yeah
16:08 < gradius> its the newest bot

16:12 < gradius> I'm not a good coder by any stretch of the imagination, so have at it :)

16:16 < hotdogs> DrItanium: make sure you do some profiling first
16:16 < hotdogs> can you switch in python?
16:16 < gradius> ot that I know of
16:16 < gradius> :(
16:16 < DrItanium> hotdogs: message.split()[0] over and over
16:17 < hotdogs> what?
16:17 < hotdogs> I thought you were referring to switch/case statements
16:17 < DrItanium> irc.py, the command lookup is continually calling message.split()[0] over and over again when it can be cached

16:30 < DrItanium> gradius: I did just that, I'm almost done with my first edit
16:30 < gradius> DrItanium: I really appreciate it, there are times I'm just hacking stuff together and not paying attention
16:30 < prometheusx> i don't feel like doing my java final, im in summer mode
16:31 < hotdogs> fail the class, who cares
16:32 < prometheusx> i'd probably get a b if i skiped the final

16:41 < gradius> DrItanium: kk :)
16:41 < gradius> I'll check it now
16:42 < gradius> You pushed or you did a pull request?
16:42 < gradius> There's a difference :)
16:42 < DrItanium> I forked your code and pushed some changes to my fork
16:42 < DrItanium> That way if my changes actually break things, the damage is contained
16:43 < gradius> Yeah, and I was saying do a pull request from github
16:43 < DrItanium> oh
16:43 < DrItanium> one second
16:43 < gradius> Oh god, that spliting shit IS really bad.
16:43 < gradius> idk why I did it so many times.
16:44 < DrItanium> Alright
16:44 < gradius> I hope you did that with a sed or something.
16:44 < gradius> lol
16:44 < hotdogs> or vim.
16:44 < gradius> that too

17:04 < DrItanium> ah!
17:04 < DrItanium> I didn't think that would actually crash
17:04 < DrItanium> But I thought it might
17:05 < gradius> Hmm well if oyu wanna take a crack at it I gotta leave work lol
17:05 < gradius> I'll be on later though.
17:05 < DrItanium> Not really :p
17:05 < gradius> It's something silly I know but Im busy haha
17:05 < gradius> kk
17:05 < gradius> I'll fixit later
17:19 < DrItanium> gradius: Sorry, I'm just terrible at python
17:20 < hotdogs> you should just keep referencing the split array
17:41 < DrItanium> gradius: I bit the bullet and added the conditional to fix the split[1] problem
17:42 < hotdogs> but there's a spot that uses split[2]
17:42 < DrItanium> I know
17:42 < DrItanium> but those are referenced using split[2]
17:42 < DrItanium> they are far and few between but alright
17:42 < DrItanium> I'll fix that too
17:42 < hotdogs> then why not have everything just use split[0], split[1], split[2]
17:43 < DrItanium> reduce the number of array accesses
17:43 < hotdogs> what's wrong with array accesses?
17:43 < DrItanium> you have to load the array, compute the offset, and then pull the value out of memory
17:44 < DrItanium> hotdogs: I could also make the argument that binding them to variables makes them more readable too
17:44 < hotdogs> how many times do you do that in for each command? once each time it is necessary
17:45 < DrItanium> and thus the code can be easier to maintain
17:45 < DrItanium> hotdogs: I'm thinking about the fail conditions, not success
17:45 < hotdogs> yes, he needs to actually check input
17:45 < hotdogs> I thought you were thinking about performance
17:45 < hotdogs> doing a bunch of if's at the beginning for args that might not even be used is silly
17:45 < DrItanium> hotdogs: I was at the beginning but not so much now. More readability than anything else
17:46 < DrItanium> hotdogs: Those values are also technically invariant to the conditionals
17:46 < DrItanium> But at this point, it's more for readability and maintainability
17:46 < hotdogs> it's 200 lines
17:47 < hotdogs> and I'd be focusing effort on not-breakingility right now
17:47 < DrItanium> You shouldn't make a distinction if the code is 20, 200, or 2000 lines
17:47 < hotdogs> since it doesn't seem to check that the second and third args exist before using them
17:47 < DrItanium> hotdogs: I just added those checks actually
17:48 < DrItanium> hotdogs: gradius used try/except as a catch all
17:48 < hotdogs> good ole exceptions
17:49 < hotdogs> time to throw control into the air and see who catches it!
17:50 < DrItanium> also the need for nested try/except seems extremely excessive, especially when the except actions of the nested try/excepts are the same as the outer except
17:50 < hotdogs> probably just from copypasta
17:51 < DrItanium> yah
17:51 < DrItanium> God this is like trying to map out a brickwall with an electron microscope. Let's write these as rules in clips first
17:52  * hotdogs backs away slowly
17:54 < DrItanium> lol self.load.load
18:00 < airen> lol
18:02 < hotdogs> also, shame on gradius for being a bad maintainer
18:02 < hotdogs> "SURE I'LL MERGE THIS WITHOUT TESTING"
18:04 < airen> Needs moar branches
18:06 < DrItanium> I actually told him to look it over before he ran it
18:24 < sunrise> prometheusx: I love tents!
18:25 < DrItanium> lol
18:25 < sunrise> hahahha
18:25 < sunrise> so I just had a dream where I put my car on autodrive and took a nap
18:26 < sunrise> woke up an hour later and was still driving ;)
18:26 < sunrise> bitches
18:26 < sunrise> ^is so not cool
18:26 < DrItanium> sunrise: We're you working for mercedes-benz and they forgot to tell you they disabled the feature?
18:27 < sunrise> if I was I'd have died
18:27 < DrItanium> But it was all dream....
18:27 < DrItanium> Just like reality.....
18:27 < hotdogs> maybe in your dream you woke up after dying
18:27 < sunrise> I woke up after 5 transformer robots danced
18:27 < DrItanium> Dream within a Dream
18:27 < hotdogs> that usually startles me awake as well
18:27 < DrItanium> sunrise: Was there a dancing calculator launching fireworks?
18:28 < sunrise> OH YEAH I wonder if I dreamed during the nap in the car, whooaa
18:28 < sunrise> DrItanium: no... there was not..
18:28 < DrItanium> sunrise: Sigh, I'm alone on that one then :(
18:28 < sunrise> DrItanium: o-o
18:28 < sunrise> haha:)
18:29 < sunrise> I think one of the coolest dreams I had was when I was on a field trip in a forest, and we all had to crawl, we weren't allowed to stand up
18:29 < sunrise> so I stood up
18:29 < DrItanium> Actually, that was the end of the dream...the content before that was even stranger
18:29 < sunrise> and the world changed to a fucking island in a blizzard
18:30 < sunrise> and there was super militia in front of this tower we were headed towards
18:30 < sunrise> and I freaked out and sat down and was in a forest again
18:30 < sunrise> >:(
18:30 < sunrise> DrItanium: haha I love dreams, they are so random!!
18:30 < DrItanium> sunrise: Let me guess, you had a railgun in one hand and 3 foot pistol in the other
18:31 < sunrise> DrItanium: I wish, that dream was like, before I'd ever played an fps
18:31 < sunrise> a*
18:32 < sunrise> that's weird, how do we use "a" and "an" with acronyms?
18:32 < DrItanium> explode the acronym see what sounds right and then implode it back
18:33 < sunrise> but if we say "eff-pee-ess" in real life
18:33 < sunrise> do we say an or a?
18:33 < hotdogs> I have strange dreams about my teeth breaking and/or moving
18:33 < DrItanium> then the word has already been exploded and imploded without having to do anything!
18:34  * sunrise cringes.
18:34 < hotdogs> a/an is entirely for pronunciation
18:35 < hotdogs> so you can use it to tell if someone calls them an o-day or a zero-day for 0day
18:35 < hotdogs> or, you know, an hero
18:36 < sunrise> LOL
18:36 < DrItanium> I think the strangest dream was when The Opera merged with real life. So many doves .......
18:36 < sunrise> an hero is just hard to say
18:36 < DrItanium> hotdogs: 10/10
18:37 < hotdogs> what did I do
18:37 < DrItanium> an hero
18:37 < hotdogs> I'm not dead!
18:37 < DrItanium> exactly!
18:38 < DrItanium> Massive allergy to lead
18:47  * DrItanium shakes his head and blue butterflies come out
21:33 < zero-one> hotdogs: what about a zero-one day
22:14 < hotdogs> zero-one: I hates them
--- Day changed Fri Jun 08 2012

00:10 < swiss> so I know nada anymore
00:10 < alexjandro> thats gonna be an expensive tow to get it home
00:11 < swiss> it only needs an alignment
00:11 < swiss> but knowing my dad, he's gonna tow it anyways
00:11 < swiss> and then bitch about the cost in a week
00:11 < alexjandro> i thought you said the wheel would turn all the way with no effort
00:11 < alexjandro> and that you were scared to drive it or something
00:11 < alexjandro> long distances
00:13 < swiss> yeah, but i decided that's just an alignment thing
00:16 < swiss> gradius: are you comin or now
00:16 < swiss> not
00:16 < alexjandro> 00:04:48 < gradius> nah that would be a BAD idea.

00:55 < sunrise> I love it
00:55 < sunrise> lemme see your guys irssi themes so I can compare >:O
00:56 < alexjandro> let me see yours first
00:56 < DrItanium> sunrise: Hex values?

00:58 < DrItanium> Really?
00:59 < alexjandro> sunrise: how do i get that hilight thing on top
00:59 < alexjandro> what is it called
00:59 < sunrise> hilight
00:59 < sunrise> .pl
01:01 < sunrise> ?
01:01 < sunrise> but you need to split your screen and lock it to the top on
01:01 < sunrise> one*
01:01 < sunrise> the only problem with this theme is I need to make everyone elses typing a bit brighter
01:02 < sunrise> but I'm lazy
01:02 < sunrise> D:
01:06 < swiss> alexjandro: highlightwin
01:07 < sunrise> lol swiss, I just checked my scripts and I'm using the old version of hilightwin
01:07 < sunrise> sorry alexjandro it was hilightwin not hilight!
01:15 < alexjandro> who wants to set it up for me

01:42 < swiss> sunrise: that game's actually really fun
01:42 < swiss> i loved it
01:43 < swiss> I love the aisaka in the maid tails
01:51 < sunrise> I played it when I was younger, reliving the glory:)
04:49 < swiss> that moment when you realize you don't like booting windows
04:49 < swiss> and run rm -rf /media/sda1/*
04:49 < swiss> and feel really really good
08:27 < swiss> https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=h2yWAH4a4N4#! this is terrible, yet hillarious
08:27 < swiss> john hughes movies/star wars parody

11:43 < hotdogs> GFACE
12:00 < airen> FRIENDFACE
12:02 < hotdogs> I don't understand how they will make money then
12:02 < hotdogs> ads? selling your info? cosmetic items?
12:06 < alexjandro> hotdogs: 1. Make game 2. Let people play for free 3. ??? 4. PROFIT!!!
12:08 < hotdogs> a true alexjandro business model
12:09 < hotdogs> are you consulting for them?
12:13 < prometheusx> the free to play part is just to upsell them crap later
12:56 < DrItanium> That was an interesting interview
12:56 < DrItanium> I got schooled that I didn't do bundle level scheduling....lol. So I picked the interviewers brain for info on critical path analysis
14:18 < gradius> Holy shit playing LoL at riot.
14:19 < gradius> I feel badass now.
14:19 < gradius> Anyone wanna play with me? :)
14:22 < gradius> zero-one: come play LoL with me!

15:31 < sunrise> prometheusx: your mom hurts my eyes.
15:31 -!- zero-one_ [~zero-one@zer0-one.net] has joined #testgradius

19:44 < airen> MOOMBLE
20:13 < gradius> holy fucking shit. riot is awesome. also, I'll wanna play LoL late tonight if anyone is game (read:12ish)
20:13 < gradius> afk for now, movies :)
21:41 < swiss> why do i not sleep
21:48 < timtimmah> drink more
21:48 < DrItanium> So I guess it's possible to have a basic block be part of a region and a loop at the same time :/
21:49 < swiss> timtimmah: i'm at ~40 hours now
21:50 < timtimmah> swiss: more caffeine
21:50 < swiss> i don't know why i'm staying up, but I can't convince myself to go to sleep
21:50 < swiss> i don't do caffiene
21:50 < DrItanium> swiss: Sounds like classic signs of depression
21:50 < swiss> DrItanium: I stayed up last night out of fear of failing to wake up for my guitar final
21:50 < swiss> cause that'd be embarassing
21:50 < swiss> but now, I have almost no urge to sleep
21:53 < DrItanium> Well then just put on some Megadeth and fall asleep
21:53 < swiss> lawl
21:53 < DrItanium> I just figured out how to use the loop information I just gleaned to my advantage
21:53 < DrItanium> swiss: Well actually I think that would keep you awake more since it rocks
21:54 < zero-one> swiss: wanna LoL with me?
21:54 < DrItanium> I also found LoL rule 34 on fakku :/
21:54 < swiss> zero-one: not really
21:54 < DrItanium> That was pretty awful
21:55 < DrItanium> Although I didn't read it
21:55 < swiss> DrItanium: look up ahri pictures
21:56 < DrItanium> swiss: I'm going to pass.....
21:56 < swiss> DrItanium: they have a dakimakura of it
21:56 < swiss> you know what that is, right
21:57 < DrItanium> swiss: No...but I have a feeling I will pretty shortly
21:57 < swiss> DrItanium: the japanese hug pillows, full size
21:57 < DrItanium> Oh! lol, not suprised
21:57 < swiss> http://league-of-legends.soup.io/post/234185996/Ahri-dakimakura-cover
21:57 < swiss> they white-spotted over the naughty parts
21:57 < DrItanium> sigh...this is like a train wreck
21:58 < swiss> hahaha
21:58 < swiss> And it costs like $100
21:58 < DrItanium> >_>
21:58 < swiss> if it was $30 or under i was gonna prank buy it for a friend
21:59 < zero-one> we could take that money, and invest it in gene splicing that produces hot-looking fox-girls
21:59 < DrItanium> Right! Prank ;)
22:00 < swiss> lolol
22:00 < swiss> zero-one: i'd be down
22:01 < DrItanium> Pair of pliers and a blowtorch ?
22:03 < DrItanium> Now I want to watch Pulp Fiction...fucking beautiful
22:04 < swiss> DrItanium: truestory
22:05 < swiss> I want to watch FLCL on blu ray
22:05 < swiss> but I'm marathoning it with a friend within a week
22:05 < swiss> and I don't wanna burn out
22:05 < DrItanium> swiss: So let me get this straight. You want to watch FLCL while murdering pfhor en masse?
22:06 < DrItanium> with the flamethrower exclusively
22:06 < DrItanium> Good luck against the juggernauts
22:06 < swiss> believe me, i got this
22:06 < swiss> i can do anything while I watch FLCL
22:06 < swiss> it's like my anti-kryptonite
22:06 < DrItanium> On Total Carnage though?
22:06 < swiss> hmmm
22:07 < swiss> that's a tricky one
22:07 < DrItanium> Vidmaster Challenge :D
22:07 < swiss> lol
22:08 < DrItanium> Although that would be fists only. Except for one bullet on cool fusion to get out of the starting room
22:08 < swiss> FUCKYEAH.JPG
22:08 < swiss> I PASSED MATH
22:08 < DrItanium> Congrats
22:08 < swiss> DrItanium: it was very borderline
22:09 < DrItanium> Still, don't argue with me. You passed a math class...ACCEPT MY CONGRATULATIONS
22:09 < swiss> I ACCEPT YOUR CONGRATULATIONS WITH GREAT HONOR
22:09 < DrItanium> WOOOOOO
22:10 < swiss> THIS WILL BE PUT ON THE FRIDGE WITH A MAGNET
22:10 < swiss> not the grade, the congratulations
22:10 < DrItanium> lol
22:12 < swiss> http://epicsnaps.com/detail/wQToz/Guy-who-almost-hit-bella-with-a-car/Im-a-Mac
22:12 < swiss> s/PC/gentoo machine/
22:12 < DrItanium> lol
22:34 < hotdogs> is that really an imgur clone
22:42 < swiss> hotdogs: no idea
22:42 < swiss> someone facebook psoted
22:43 < sunrise> I hate
22:43 < sunrise> my computer
22:43 < sunrise> I can't find the problem
22:43 < sunrise> it's using too much ram and I've been working on fixing it ALL DAY
22:43 < hotdogs> too much?
22:44 < sunrise> around 50% physical memory being used
22:44 < hotdogs> you've still got 50% left
22:44 < sunrise> yes but my computer is slower
22:44 < sunrise> I can't game on 50% ram being used
22:45 < DrItanium> sunrise: Close firefox
22:45 < sunrise> seriously?
22:46 < DrItanium> yes
22:46 < sunrise> I've been working on this all day, and you think I need to close fucking firefox?
22:46 < sunrise> thanks
22:46 < DrItanium> If you have a ton of tabs open...yeah
22:46 < sunrise> I don't even HAVE a browser open
22:46 < DrItanium> Firefox consumes like 400 megs of ram for me in gentoo....
22:46 < sunrise> I've rebooted
22:46 < sunrise> I've defragged
22:46 < DrItanium> Wait....
22:46 < sunrise> I've cleared GB's of free space
22:46 < DrItanium> There's a difference between consumed and actually used
22:47 < DrItanium> Sometimes the OS will reserve ram for processes and free it if necessary
22:47 < sunrise> you should look at my fucking perfmon
22:47 < sunrise> it's going fucking crazy
22:47 < DrItanium> post itr
22:47 < sunrise> sorry I'm sick and in a bad moo d;(
22:47 < sunrise> mood*
22:47 < DrItanium> sunrise: I've seen much worse :)
22:47 < DrItanium> I know the feeling too
22:49 < DrItanium> How much ram do you have?
22:49 < sunrise> actually perfmon looks better now than earlier
22:49 < sunrise> guess the defrag and freespace did something good
22:49 < sunrise> but the memory
22:49 < sunrise> 4gb's
22:50 < DrItanium> Windows 7/Vista has a disk cache so that's probably what you're looking at
22:50 < sunrise> ?
22:51 < DrItanium> Windows keeps track of what you consistently access from the HDD and will cache it into memory (It will even do different things based on the time of day...although it's not that good)
22:52 < sunrise> http://i.imgur.com/UWTkx.png
22:53 < sunrise> oh
22:53 < sunrise> cache
22:53 < DrItanium> how many processes are you running?
22:54 < DrItanium> Like TeaTimer.exe is consuming 75 megs of ram...you could kill that
22:55 < DrItanium> You have an HP computer don't you?
23:02 < sunrise> sony
23:02 < sunrise> vaio
23:02 < sunrise> laptop
23:02 < sunrise> teatimer is nothing
23:02 < DrItanium> Ahh, that's why....fucking vaio
23:02 < sunrise> just part of a program I downloaded to get rid of this shit
23:02 < sunrise> it's just the dumb cache
23:02 < sunrise> so never mind
23:02 < sunrise> this whole day has been a waste
23:03 < DrItanium> It's also the fact that the vaio software is a pile of fail and chews through ram like crazy
23:04 < sunrise> ok.
23:04 < DrItanium> So you may want to try and disable some of vaio software from starting up
23:06 < sunrise> look
23:06 < sunrise> it doesn't need fixing
23:06 < sunrise> it's just a visual bug
23:06 < sunrise> half my ram is cached
23:06 < DrItanium> Are you sure?
23:07 < DrItanium> Yeah, 7 does something similar on my machine. It consumes like 12% of 32 gigs
23:08 < DrItanium> I wouldn't say the day is wasted though.....
23:08 < DrItanium> But I'm hopelessly optimistic!
23:14 < sunrise> well look in the pictur
23:14 < sunrise> 2088 cached
23:15 < sunrise> 4043 total
23:15 < sunrise> that's half my ram
23:15 < DrItanium> Oh...you were going off of the free value?
23:15 < DrItanium> lol
23:15 < DrItanium> I thought you were worried about the green part
23:15 < sunrise> isn't the green part the cached part?
23:16 < sunrise> oh fuck
23:16 < sunrise> it's not
23:16 < zero-one> today's a bad day
23:16 < zero-one> i only have 4GB of ram today
23:16 < zero-one> i'll probably have 6 tomorrow
23:16 < sunrise> fuck my fucking computer :(
23:16 < DrItanium> zero-one: I only have 32230 megs of ram
23:16 < zero-one> lol
23:17 < zero-one> DrItanium: between how many sticks?
23:18 < DrItanium> four
23:18 < DrItanium> I have four slots free
23:18 < zero-one> lol
23:18 < sunrise> DrItanium: why is all this ram being used.......
23:18 < zero-one> 64GB of RAM
23:18 < zero-one> FUCKING DOOEET
23:18 < DrItanium> zero-one: That's the plan eventually
23:19 < DrItanium> it can go up to 512 gb of registered memory 64 gigs of non registered
23:19 < DrItanium> sunrise: Different programs....
23:20 < sunrise> then tell me why YESTERDAY this ram wasn't being used.
23:20 < DrItanium> Did you install anything new yesterday?
23:20 < sunrise> not beforehand
23:20 < DrItanium> wat?
23:21 < zero-one> sunrise: open up msconfig, and start knocking off things on startup that you don't need
23:21 < DrItanium> Do you have updates being installed/downloaded?
23:21 < sunrise> once I noticed it I installed like, ace utilities, hijack this..
23:21 < sunrise> etc
23:21 < sunrise> what do you mean being installed/downloaded?
23:21 < DrItanium> Is windows update running?
23:22 < sunrise> I have
23:22 < sunrise> nothing running
23:23 < sunrise> I think I would notice if an update was running -_-
23:23 < airen> sunrise: Main problem here is Windows.
23:23 < DrItanium> But there are a bunch of vaio programs running Oasis2Service.exe, VCAgent.exe
23:23 < DrItanium> etc
23:23 < DrItanium> airen: Too true
23:23 < sunrise> fucking
23:23 < DrItanium> It's also that the stock Sony installation of Windows is bogged down with tons of bloatware :/
23:24 < zero-one> sunrise: first thing i do with a new machine, reformat
23:24 < sunrise> yeah but DrItanium those have been running since BEFORE yesterday
23:24 < DrItanium> Either you've installed something as a side effect of a game or windows just decided to do something festive!
23:24 < sunrise> I don't give a crap about your opinions on my computer, I never said I loved windows
23:25 < DrItanium> Right now linux is consuming 1260 megs of ram
23:25 < DrItanium> But I'm on a NUMA system so things work differently
23:26 < DrItanium> s/NUMA/multiprocessor/
23:26 < zero-one> a NUMA NUMA system
23:26 < DrItanium> zero-one: Do you even know what NUMA is?
23:26 < zero-one> DrItanium: never heard of it actually
23:27 < zero-one> let's see...
23:27 < zero-one> non-uniform memory access
23:27 < airen> You can google.
23:27 < DrItanium> Most multiprocessor systems are setup so that each processor has it's own bank of directly accessible memory. This divides it into two parts (local and non-local)....local is faster than non-local (another processor)
23:27 < airen> Congrats.
23:28 < DrItanium> So on my machine, each processor has four ram slots allocated to it
23:28 < airen> sunrise: umad?
23:29 < zero-one> DrItanium: got it
23:29 < DrItanium> With NUMA, it's necessary to have copies of data on each processor
23:30 < DrItanium> Plus I have like 150 PCI devices
23:30 < zero-one> haha
23:30 < DrItanium> So many random devices * 2
23:30 < airen> DrItanium: Yeah, but do you have drives with NCQ?
23:30 < DrItanium> airen: Yes...Ten of them in fact
23:31 < DrItanium> 8 attached to my raid card and 2 for windows
23:31 < airen> I remember when NCQ was new.
23:31 < DrItanium> so do I .....
23:31 < airen> SCSI had TCQ before that.
23:31 < DrItanium> Wait....do ssd's have NCQ
23:31 < airen> Pretty sure they do.
23:31 < DrItanium> ahhhh....TCQ...brings me back....my itanium boxes have drives with TCQ
23:31 < airen> Depending on the model.
23:32 < DrItanium> But NCQ seems unnecessary on an SSD
23:32 < DrItanium> It is used
23:32 < airen> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Command_Queuing
23:32 < DrItanium> Ahh, interesting
23:32 < DrItanium> yeah that's what I'm reading right now
23:33 < DrItanium> well let me see if NCQ is enabled on dat ssd
23:34 < DrItanium> zero-one: 7f:0b.3 System peripheral: Intel Corporation Sandy Bridge Semaphore and Scratchpad Configuration Registers (rev 07)
23:34 < zero-one> the fuck is that?
23:35 < zero-one> "semaphore and scratchpad"
23:35 < DrItanium> DAT CS
23:35 < DrItanium> A semaphore is a locking construct for threading
23:35 < DrItanium> scratchpad registers are exactly what they sound like. Scratchpad registers to store data
23:36 < airen> DrItanium: http://mangafox.me/manga/vita_sexualis/v01/c001/1.html
23:36 < zero-one> i knew what a semaphore was
23:36 < zero-one> no idea about a "scratchpad register"
23:37 < DrItanium> Apparently my raid card is codenamed Liberator...awesome :D
23:38 < zero-one> lol
23:39 < DrItanium> But that's not right
23:40 < DrItanium> The naming isn't correct :/

23:47 < DrItanium> airen: I'm still reading the first one but 10/10
23:50 < airen> I think most of these will be up your alley to some degree and most of them are short.
23:51 < airen> Alright bed time!

11:59 < hotdogs> timtimmah: http://www.delcomproducts.com/productdetails.asp?productnum=803656
11:59 < hotdogs> if I could find a cheaper foot pedal that says it will be a joystick I think that would work pretty well
11:59 < hotdogs> have to make sure joystick controls are disabled in games, but other than that...
12:09 < hotdogs> http://i.imgur.com/atUaO.png even though this is dota2 it's still pretty relevant
12:57 < zero-one> hotdogs: fucking lol'd at the battleship
13:03 < hotdogs> that's a destroyer
13:03 < hotdogs> what the fuck is wrong with you
13:05 < hotdogs> http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/battleships/sdakota/sdak-1942.jpg
13:05 < hotdogs> that's both an amazing photo and a good comparison
13:41 < timtimmah> hotdogs: I dig it except for the price
13:42 < hotdogs> yeah that's why I said cheaper
13:42 < hotdogs> find an old usb joystick and hack it up, lololo
13:43 < timtimmah> AWW YEAH
13:43 < timtimmah> goodwill
13:43 < hotdogs> only problem is games will totally be like "oh man a joystick, disabling keyboard"
13:44 < timtimmah> yeah...
13:44 < hotdogs> and if you ever try to use a gamepad
13:47 < swiss> I still have my old microsoft sidewinder somewhere
14:05 < hotdogs> is it usb?
14:05 < hotdogs> I guess you're too young to not have usb controllers
14:05 < swiss> i have usb and a serial(I think) controller
14:05 < hotdogs> though parents have a habit of being super cheap
14:05 < swiss> dunno where the serial port controller is.
14:05 < hotdogs> it's not serial, it's gameport
14:06 < swiss> gameport then
14:06 < hotdogs> mice used to be serial
14:06 < hotdogs> it double as joysticks and midi
14:06 < hotdogs> on sound cards
14:06 < hotdogs> THE MORE YOU KNOW
14:14 < swiss> so this computer I just got to work on....
14:15 < swiss> the hard drive... wasn't even in a mount
14:15 < swiss> it was sitting loose on the bottom
14:15 < hotdogs> hell yeah
14:15 < swiss> also, it has extra fans.... also loose
14:15 < swiss> not secured to aynthing
14:15 < swiss> just laying aorund in the case
14:15 < hotdogs> do they have leds?
14:16 < swiss> of course
14:16 < swiss> see through sideplate as well
14:16 < hotdogs> what color
14:16 < swiss> and a temperature gauge on the front
14:16 < swiss> green and blue
14:16 < hotdogs> oh good
14:16 < hotdogs> whose computer is it
14:16 < swiss> some guy at a support group my parents go to
14:16 < swiss> well, his nephews
14:17 < swiss> i have to reset the windwos password on it
14:17 < swiss> but the ubuntu live cd I put in it is taking forever to boot
14:17 < swiss> but I don't see any boot errors
14:17 < swiss> nvm, nw it looks like it's workin
14:19 < hotdogs> just use, uhh, that one usb thing that makes it so you don't need a password
14:34 < swiss> or i can follow http://cdn.slashgeek.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Screenshot-from-2012-06-09-124649.png

14:52 < swiss> i have physical accesss
14:52 < swiss> he dropped it off at my hosue
14:52 < hotdogs> with the thing that I can't think of the name of, you go straight in as him, and his password is still there after
14:52 < swiss> oh
14:52 < hotdogs> "so? I can do it the long way still"
14:52 < hotdogs> I can't remember the name of it though so you might as well do a reset
15:01 < swiss> fff, dhcp is all fucked up at my hosue
15:01 < swiss> and my dad doesn't want to admit it
15:02 < swiss> and it's taking me much longer cause I can't get this box on the internet
15:03 < hotdogs> static IP that shit
15:06 < swiss> I tried, and it had issues
15:06 < swiss> i don't know why cause I'm bad at networking
15:07 < swiss> but I set the route the same, same gateway, same everything but IP address
15:27 < swiss> lol, that was easy
15:28 < swiss> this computer is friggin slow though
15:28 < swiss> makes my laptop feel fast
15:29 < hotdogs> I forget if I imagined it or if I really have encountered a router that didn't pass your traffic if it didn't dhcp your address
15:29 < hotdogs> and of course it's slow, it's some asshole's windows install
15:30 < hotdogs> I don't know why you'd think it would be a good idea to drop it on your network, either
15:31 < swiss> hotdogs: I didn't once I started windows
15:31 < swiss> as soon as I shut down ubuntu I yanked that ethernet
15:31 < hotdogs> ah
15:32 < hotdogs> so what exactly are you fixing
15:36 < swiss> they lost their passwords
15:36 < swiss> so I just had to wipe the passwords
15:36 < alexjandro> ophcrack that shit
15:36 < swiss> took 30 seconds once I got networking
15:36 < swiss> airen: fuck that, just blanked them out

08:42 < hotdogs> actually, it's the double click selection that does that
08:42 < hotdogs> not sure why I didn't open it the normal way...
10:17 < airen> hotdogs: Must be VTE then.
10:17 < airen> hotdogs: Because same problemo with sakura.
10:17 < hotdogs> which?
10:17 < airen> ! breaks urls
10:17 < hotdogs> url matching or double click matching?
10:17 < hotdogs> I think the regex is provided by the app
10:17 < airen> Oh?
10:18 < hotdogs> because the url matching works fine for me, it was double click matching that wasn't getting all of it
10:18 < hotdogs> yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen the regex in the source
10:21 < airen> I should file a bug. I have a launchpad account.
12:12 < gradius> well my website needs to be fixed. thanks for pointing all that shit out.
12:12 < gradius> and doinitwrong was redirecting correctly, since I'm using wordpress multisite
12:13 < gradius> and didn't have a default wildcard set for anything else.
12:13 < gradius> Also hotdogs
12:13 < gradius> where is that 4chan image for dayz performance.
12:13 < gradius> since I'm not sure how to search for it on irc.
12:14 < hotdogs> UGH

12:20 < timtimmah> I can slow down if you like.
12:20 < hotdogs> I'LL DEAL WITH IT
12:20 < prometheusx> he needs time to get ready for the date
12:20 < hotdogs> I need to find my condoms
12:20 < timtimmah> prometheusx: He doesn't need to look special for me
12:20 < timtimmah> hotdogs: I always have some with me, remember?

16:29 < gradius> i thought i was
16:29 < swiss> ABOUT TO COOK ME SOME RICE

16:29 < gradius> nope
16:33 < swiss> gradius: YEP
16:33 < gradius> hotdogs: I cant lastlog the field of view settings you told me to use
16:33 < swiss> so guys, i ran out of hotkey channels
16:33 < gradius> can you PM them to me? :)
16:34 < swiss> and I don't want to close any or remap my keys
16:34 < gradius> swiss: I've had 25+ channels for over a year.
16:34 < swiss> what do I do
16:34 < gradius>  /win is your friend
16:34 < swiss> gradius: I've been closing PM channels as to not go over 19
16:34 < timtimmah> ctrl + p
16:34 < timtimmah> ctrl + n
16:34 < swiss> i use alt+a right now
16:34 < swiss> go to active window
16:34 < swiss> (had activity)
16:34 < swiss> but I hate typign /win
16:34 < gradius> well deal with it
16:34 < gradius> k
16:34  * gradius &
16:35 < swiss> gradius: but i don't wannnnaaa
16:35 < swiss> come type it for me
16:35 < swiss> I'll say "alt 20" and you type /win 20 for me
16:44 < timtimmah> I'll do it for you
16:44 < timtimmah> But it'll be $42.50 every time you speak.
16:47 < swiss> hmmm
16:47 < DrItanium> Are you seriously contemplating paying 42.50 when you could just do an optimization of your layout ?
16:48 < swiss> DrItanium: no, i'm contemplating a way to exploit this
16:48 < timtimmah> swiss: no way to exploit it.
16:49 < DrItanium> Using american sign language would count as speech because it is a language
16:49 < swiss> DrItanium: what if I held up a sign that said "Alt 21"
16:49 < DrItanium> You're speaking with words
16:49 < timtimmah> swiss: Then I wouldn't comply.
16:49 < DrItanium> Instead of sounds
16:50 < timtimmah> I will only respond to verbal commands which ends when I press enter.
16:50 < timtimmah> For each tiem I press enter(or submit a command) I will charge you $42.50
16:51 < timtimmah> I also have some great beachfront property in Kansas to sell you
16:51 < swiss> k, I'll remove the enter key, and only have it on my keyboard
16:51 < swiss> you just type the command, I'll hit enter
16:51 < DrItanium> std::cout << "Roflcopter" << std::endl
16:51 < timtimmah> You forgot the "submit a command" bit
16:51 < DrItanium> swiss: That sounds like a contradiction
16:51 < DrItanium> You'll remove the enter key but have it
16:52 < swiss> DrItanium: he has his own keyboard plugged into my computer to type the /win commands
16:52 < prometheusx> he'll create an enter remote
16:52 < timtimmah> doesn't matter, I'd still be submitting a command
16:52 < DrItanium> 210 megs and rising
16:52 < DrItanium> 211 megs
16:52 < timtimmah> DrItanium: watcha doin?
16:53 < DrItanium> Thesis work
16:53 < timtimmah> Nice
16:53 < timtimmah> How large do you expect it to get?
16:53 < DrItanium> I cut down the running time by half by swapping out send commands with the equivalent during instruction construction
16:53 < DrItanium> Well under 384 megs would be nice
16:53 < DrItanium> But if it's done wrong I've had it hit 10 gigs or mroe
16:53 < DrItanium> *more
16:54 < DrItanium> It will partially infinite loop and then catch itself
16:54 < DrItanium> 218Megs
16:54 < timtimmah> Good luck
16:54 < DrItanium> Oh, I'm on my Itanium box as well so that's another factor as well
16:54 < DrItanium> This is also on a 3.8 meg program
16:55 < DrItanium> That took 301 seconds to complete
16:55 < DrItanium> On my lappy it's about 80 seconds
16:55 < DrItanium> but I haven't tested it since I made the performance improvements
16:55 < DrItanium> on my lappy that is
16:56 < DrItanium> Scheduling.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, IA-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, not stripped (Size 7.3M)
16:57 < DrItanium> So many bundles
16:57  * DrItanium drools
17:01 < DrItanium> fucking gcc
17:01 < DrItanium> ld8 r37=[r14]
17:01 < DrItanium> addl r38=1575736, r1;;
17:01 < DrItanium> nop.m 0x0
17:01 < DrItanium> addl r39=1575760, r1;;
17:02 < DrItanium> Let's execute those adds in separate groups even though they are not dependent
17:02 < DrItanium> fuck
17:05 < alexjandro> wat
17:06 < DrItanium> the two adds don't need ;; between them because they have no dependencies. Thus you could execute them in parallel. As they sit right now, the Itanium processor will put a single cycle stall in between the two even though it's not necessary
17:06 < DrItanium> r1 is not being modified so there's no need for the stall
17:08 < DrItanium> or for instance
17:09 < DrItanium> gcc saves the value of the struct offset within r35 and r14 but will copy r35 into r14 even though there are times when its possible to just reference r35 and store the result into r14. This saves a couple of instructions and reduces the size of the program
17:10 < DrItanium> mov r14=r35;; std8 [r14]=r32 mov r14=r35;;
17:10 < DrItanium> Let's change that to
17:10 < DrItanium> std8 [r35] = r32
17:11 < DrItanium> Fuck
17:21 < hotdogs> gradius: I linked it to you

21:15 < zero-one> come for the mac, stay for the zoom lens
21:16 < swiss> and if they didn't ditch the ethernet port, i might have gotten one
21:16 < swiss> and the fact the keyboard sucks...
21:17 < DrItanium> swiss: They give you usb3 and two thunderbolts (they sell an adapter for ethernet) and THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURE AN SDXC SLOT! DAMN WE NEEDED THAT BUT NOT ETHERNET....:(
21:17 < zero-one> no ethernet port?
21:17 < zero-one> wat
21:17 < swiss> zero-one: he's pointing otu their dumbass-ery
21:17 < zero-one> swiss: i know
21:17 < zero-one> i'm still stuck on "no ethernet"
21:17 < DrItanium> zero-one: You can make the notebook smaller if you take out the ethernet jack (height of the port)
21:18 < zero-one> DrItanium: at what point does size matter so much that it's worth the price of PRECIOUS PRECIOUS ETHERNET
21:18 < swiss> DrItanium: then again, their market... the idiots that think they can take pictures and use a mac to deal with them need that sdxc slot, and probably don't know what ethernet it
21:18 < swiss> ethernet is*
21:18 < DrItanium> zero-one: They sell a thunderbolt to ethernet (gigabit) adapter
21:22 < mendez> swiss: thanks
21:23 < swiss> I just don't understand why it's not like that by default -_-
21:24 < DrItanium> swiss: I don't know but the motherboard looks like a goomba

21:32 < DrItanium> Plus they got rid of hte 17" mac books
21:32 < DrItanium> about fucking time
21:42 < DrItanium> That new screen is far wider than my display setup
21:42 < DrItanium> but not in height
21:42 < DrItanium> 1920x2160
21:43 < DrItanium> Awww yeah!
22:37 < hotdogs> that's disturbingly square
22:37 < DrItanium> hotdogs: Actually it's two monitors in a stack layout
22:38 < hotdogs> I know, I remember

22:41 < DrItanium> airen: THEY HAVE ADAPTERS! BUT THEY KEPT THE SDXC SLOT!

00:04 < hotdogs> gradius: I don't think I can play after ~10 except on th/fr/sa/su
00:04 < hotdogs> since it's 4/10 now
00:04 < airen> hotdogs: Jelly.
00:09 < hotdogs> why
00:09 < airen> hotdogs: The idea of 4/10s appeals to me.
00:10 < hotdogs> working 7-6 sucks
00:10 < airen> I'd rather have another day then having 4hrs to myself every weekday.
00:11 < hotdogs> I don't think you can just up someone's schedule to 10 hours a day and expect things to continue normally
00:11 < hotdogs> I'm fairly certain nobody is doing anything important from 5-6
00:12 < airen> Isn't that how it normally is?
00:12 < airen> I think that 40hrs of work a week is really hitting a diminishing return.
00:13 < airen> There is only so much attention you can pay to a subject in a day.
00:13 < hotdogs> if you really wanted to actually get 40 hours of work out of someone, you'd do 6 hours a day all week
00:13 < hotdogs> depends on the work, I suppose
00:14 < hotdogs> knowledge work is taxing though, it's not pressing buttons and pulling levers for 10 hours
00:14 < airen> Yeah.
00:15 < airen> Americans work too much.
00:15 < hotdogs> the other thing that's killer is that, since I'm so exhausted by the 4 day work week, my 3 day weekends are usually more retarded
00:15 < airen> I suppose I hadn't considered that.
00:15 < hotdogs> it's also harder to maintain a consistent sleep schedule
00:15 < hotdogs> who wants to go to bed early and wake up early on a weekend
00:15 < hotdogs> especially a THREE DAY WEEKEND!!!?
00:16 < airen> Good point.
00:16 < airen> So where does the solution lie?
00:16 < airen> When you don't want to be a robot.
00:16 < hotdogs> no idea
00:16 < airen> I think we just need investments.
00:16 < hotdogs> suicide, probably
00:16 < airen> So we can be rich dickholes.
00:16 < hotdogs> this reminds me of an essay I read once by some guy I can't remember
00:16 < hotdogs> where he asked why, when you have someone making nails 40 hours a week
00:16 < airen> Sounds possibly interesting.
00:16 < hotdogs> and you make a machine that doubles his productivity
00:17 < hotdogs> you don't halve his hours and pay him the same, and continue fulfilling demand
00:17 < hotdogs> no, you pay him the same and make him produce double and flood the shit out of the market with nails, nails, nails
00:17 < airen> MORE
00:17 < airen> GROWTH
00:17 < hotdogs> but that's what happens when you have a society that serves wealth rather than its citizens

00:30 < hotdogs> also, I have significant problems going to bed on time
00:32 < swiss> hotdogs: ikr
00:33 < zero-one> hotdogs: amen
00:34 < hotdogs> so I was looking for stands for my speakers
00:34 < hotdogs> to raise them up 6-12 inches
00:34 < hotdogs> I should probably just use old coffee cans
00:34 < hotdogs> cheap and stylish
00:36 < swiss> hotdogs: nonono
00:36 < swiss> garbanzo beans
00:36 < swiss> ALWAYS use those as stands
00:36 < swiss> full, of coures
00:36 < swiss> so they are stable
00:37 < hotdogs> that might be too wide
00:37 < hotdogs> maybe I should use a couple bricks
00:38 < hotdogs> or some cans of beans
00:38 < swiss> if you visit jbest I hear you can get cinderblocks
00:40 < hotdogs> nah those will make my music sound cold and industrial
00:44 < alexjandro> whats wrong with that
00:44 < zero-one> lol
00:45 < airen> Fuck, I need to bed.
00:47 < hotdogs> me too
00:47 < alexjandro> me three
00:48 < zero-one> me four, but fuck that
00:48 < hotdogs> butt fuck that!
00:50 < zero-one> awwwww yeah
00:51 < hotdogs> and goodnight
00:51 < zero-one> 'night
00:51 < zero-one> YOU'RE ALL A BUNCH OF FAGGOTS
00:52  * zero-one sits awake
00:54 < hotdogs> OH YEAH?
00:55 < zero-one> hotdogs: lolol
00:57 < hotdogs> what are you doing
01:00 < zero-one> admin-ing
01:00 < zero-one> on another irc network
01:01 < zero-one> some idiot added a line to the conf that required a password on connect
01:01 < zero-one> so everyone who left couldn't get back in
01:01 < zero-one> fixed it in a few seconds, and added comment above said line
01:01 < zero-one> lol
01:04 < zero-one> hotdogs: what are YOU doing?
01:08 < alexjandro> zero-one: sleeping
01:10 < zero-one> -_-
01:10 < zero-one> alexjandro: what are YOU doing?
07:55 < alexjandro> zero-one: sleeping

11:35 < hotdogs> Infected can no longer see/attack through walls.
11:35 < hotdogs> praise him
11:36 < timtimmah> swweeeettt
11:39 < hotdogs> [FIXED] Infected spawning too close to players (minimum 30m now)
11:40 < hotdogs> [FIXED] No backpacks or medical boxes spawning
11:40 < hotdogs> [NEW] Infected visibility increased (but limited by LOS)
11:40 < hotdogs> uh oh
11:41 < timtimmah> yeah... I didn't like that
11:41 < timtimmah> We might not be able to stealth through anymore
11:47 < hotdogs> might have to prone more
11:47 < prometheusx> find some ghuilie souits!
11:47 < timtimmah> ROLL ALL THE PLACES
11:48 < hotdogs> while holding alt to see where you're going
11:49 < timtimmah> like a true G
11:50 < hotdogs> I really should record stuff
11:51 < timtimmah> like fraps?
11:51 < timtimmah> If I could easily sync fraps and mumble recordings, I probably would
11:51 < hotdogs> more like craps
11:52 < hotdogs> what should I have for lunch
11:52 < timtimmah> flamebroiler
11:52 < timtimmah> I'd go with, but I'm writing this stupid thing
11:53 < alexjandro> hotdogs: rancho
11:53 < hotdogs> but I've never gone there before
11:53 < hotdogs> I don't wanna start now
11:54 < alexjandro> hotdogs: try something different
11:55 < prometheusx> alexjandro: that's crazy talk
11:58 < hotdogs> alexjandro: fuck you
12:10 < alexjandro> hotdogs: why
12:10 < hotdogs> why not
12:31 < swiss> got into my dad's router to bypass access restrictions
12:32 < swiss> trying to decide whether to make modifications to make my devices auto unblock....
12:32 < swiss> but he'd be able to see those if he ever went to change DNS
12:45 < airen> swiss: Just tunnel to your VPS.
12:46 < swiss> airen: no, this is for stuff like the 3ds
12:46 < swiss> and he has MAC address based restrictions
12:46 < swiss> unless it's a certain MAC it's not allowed in
12:46 < swiss> I could add my MACs to that pool
12:46 < alexjandro> your dad is a nazi
12:47 < swiss> true
12:53 < airen> swiss: Or just clone MACs.
12:54 < airen> MAC based restriction is laughable.
12:56 < swiss> well, do I want to try and clone macs on a 3ds?
12:56 < swiss> pretty sure it doesn't have that by default :P
13:01 < prometheusx> swiss: http://i.imgur.com/tepdk.jpg
13:02 < swiss> prometheusx: lolololol\
13:04 < airen> swiss: That's true, it should.

13:05 < swiss> hahahah
13:11 < gradius> airen: hah
15:37 < zero-one> DrItanium: do you know if there's a way to get mcs to create directories that you specify as part of the path of an output file?
15:37 < zero-one> like.. -out:foo/bar, but where foo doesn't exist yet
15:42 < gradius> http://imgur.com/Hqwb3
15:42 < gradius> lolol
15:42 < gradius> I REALLY wish cleverbot had an API
15:42 < gradius> and that the developer allowed scraping the site with automated programs.

17:43 < alexjandro> hotdogs: i had to make it bigger
17:43 < alexjandro> just for that
17:43 < hotdogs> worth it?
17:44 < prometheusx> not really

17:48 < airen> alexjandro: That doesn't make sense...
17:48 < prometheusx> that sounds more like rainbows writing
17:48 < hotdogs> the worst part is that switching to this window takes longer to show now

00:50 < gradius> i havent been to riot yet silly.
00:51 < gradius> I cant play LoL at the credit union
00:54 < hotdogs> I know
00:54 < hotdogs> that's my new joke
00:54 < hotdogs> for the next two days
01:01 < zero-one> lol
11:50 < gradius> What's fixed with the backpacks?
11:50 < hotdogs> spawning
11:50 < hotdogs> they're not really spawning right now
11:50 < gradius> Also, I can try and play tonight, but its late :(
11:50 < hotdogs> if you haven't noticed
11:50 < gradius> ahhh
11:50 < gradius> yah
11:50 < gradius> I was wondering
11:51 < gradius> the whole, working late ending late thing
11:51 < gradius> kinda an issue
11:51 < gradius> and then other days hanging out w/ ashley till 11.
11:51 < gradius> But yeah
11:51 < gradius> afk for a few
12:11 < gradius> Maybe I'll just balls up and play solo
12:11 < gradius> though I dont like to do that
12:13 < timtimmah> don't be crazy mon
12:15 < gradius> Yeah I know ... you wanna play late tonight?
12:15 < gradius> since hotdogs is an old man
12:15 < gradius> and has a bedtime
12:15 < gradius> :)
12:16 < timtimmah> I can do that
12:16 < timtimmah> I don't like night time though :(
12:16 < timtimmah> but it is easier to sneak around
12:17 < gradius> I heard that a lot of servers are moving to a different time zone after the gamma fix.
12:17 < gradius> We'll just find a fast server w/ day time.
12:31 < timtimmah> yepyep
14:05 < DrItanium> timtimmah: Be Garrett....always sneak! Blackjack to the back of the head!
14:05 < timtimmah> Too bad they're undead
14:05 < timtimmah> gotta kill them
14:06 < DrItanium> Awww...just like thief...no bops across the bonce
14:06 < timtimmah> exactly
14:06 < DrItanium> sigh...
14:06 < timtimmah> That's why I carry a pistol
14:07 < DrItanium> Loot everything!
14:08 < DrItanium> timtimmah: Oh! Congrats on graduating by the way!
14:08 < timtimmah> DrItanium: Thanks!
14:08 < timtimmah> I just figured it out today
14:08 < DrItanium> Figured out what?
14:08 < DrItanium> You graduated?
14:08 < timtimmah> That I graduated
14:08 < timtimmah> YEP
14:08 < DrItanium> lol
14:08 < DrItanium> Well, you haven't yet. The diploma hasn't been sent yet...lol
14:09 < timtimmah> 3 months later...
14:09 < DrItanium> I felt bad for the grad students when I graduated...they had to wait through the entire ceremony
14:09 < DrItanium> If they tried to leave then the bouncer would take their booklets
14:10 < timtimmah> Wwhhaatt
14:10 < DrItanium> Yeah, they were like the marines...first in last out :/
14:10 < DrItanium> Did you have a crazy guest speaker?
14:10 < timtimmah> Nah
14:11 < timtimmah> Well, I wasn't really paying attention
14:11 < DrItanium> We did, the guy got increasingly pissed off while talking about Ben Franklin
14:11 < DrItanium> It was fucking surreal
14:11 < gradius> lolololwat
14:11 < DrItanium> yup
14:11 < gradius> i just watched timtimmah play DS
14:11 < DrItanium> lol
14:11 < timtimmah> If we had more, we coulda done mario kart
14:11 < DrItanium> My Blackjack 2 died while I walked up to my car after it was over
14:12 < DrItanium> The keyboard was just done....
14:12 < DrItanium> Even Dr. Rich was taken aback by the guest speaker
14:12 < DrItanium> gradius: You graduate as well?
14:13 < DrItanium> W000 my desktop is clocked 830-1000 mhz slower than my test machines but is over 10 seconds faster with my optimization without any optimizations applied to the library
14:14  * DrItanium break dances
14:14 < DrItanium> Makes me happy because nvidia put my interview process on hold...probably to light a fire under my ass to finish my thesis (even though the fire was already there...lol)
14:16 < gradius> DrItanium: yup
14:16 < gradius> I got one more class in the summer
14:16 < DrItanium> gradius: Congrats to you as well!
14:16 < DrItanium> gradius: What class?
14:16 < gradius> but I passed my other two classes :P
14:16 < DrItanium> :D
14:16 < timtimmah> gradius: nice
14:16 < gradius> Just an ECE class to take care of an elective credit
14:16 < gradius> because I took Liu for CS301
14:16 < DrItanium> ........
14:16 < gradius> :(
14:17 < DrItanium> Got a C-?
14:17 < gradius> No
14:17 < gradius> he failed 75% of the clsas
14:17 < timtimmah> Always a good sign
14:17 < DrItanium> Liu is one of my favorite teachers but I didn't do well under him in undergrad
14:17 < gradius> like im talking F failed.
14:17 < DrItanium> I got a C in 408, 431, and 420
14:17 < gradius> not even D.
14:17 < DrItanium> :(
14:17 < DrItanium> I got an A though in Expert Systems :D
14:17 < DrItanium> Totally different teacher in graduate courses
14:17 < gradius> yeah I was talking toa  few people who got less than 30%
14:18 < gradius> I wonder why that is :(
14:18 < gradius> because it sucks I have to take one more class.
14:18 < DrItanium> Wow I almost choked on some water I was drinking
14:18 < DrItanium> That sucks
14:18 < gradius> I was like 3% away from a D
14:18 < DrItanium> But he is a difficult teacher
14:18 < gradius> which means I would have gotten the credit for it.
14:18 < gradius> he stopped replying to my emails for help after 9th week.
14:18 < gradius> It fucking sucked.
14:19 < DrItanium> Yah I know that. I studied my ass off for my phy 133 final. I worked for that D!
14:19  * gradius is just a little bit buttmad
14:19 < gradius> haha.
14:19 < gradius> But oh well!
14:19 < gradius> Passed 480 and 460 :)
14:19 < gradius> C in 460 though :(
14:19 < DrItanium> I think that by that point liu couldn't do too much and/or he was inundated with more than just you asking for help
14:19 < gradius> must have done worse on the final than I thought.
14:19 < gradius> DrItanium: likely.
14:20 < gradius> I was just kinda upset it was like 3% that messed up my elective credit
14:20 < DrItanium> I got a C in 460 as well as I hadn't had the proof epiphany yet. I didn't get that until I took 540 as a graduate instead of undergrad
14:21 < DrItanium> I had Khatchpour for 301. That guy was awesome
14:21 < DrItanium> He made fun of people for using Java instead of C++.
14:21 < DrItanium> Said that Java was good for graphics and C++ was better for scientific computation
14:22 < DrItanium> Plus he allowed infinite amounts of books and notes on his tests
14:22  * DrItanium wished more teachers would have done that 
14:22 < gradius> wow.
14:23 < gradius> Tbh, I'd like to take Khatchpour for 301...
14:23 < gradius> His programming languages class was a bit sloppy, but I can see how he'd be a good 301 prof.
14:23 < DrItanium> Yup
14:24 < hotdogs> gradius: timtimmah FUCK YOU GUYS
14:24 < gradius> hotdogs: WE LOVE YOU WE REALLY DO
14:24 < timtimmah> hotdogs: I WILL WAIT FOR YOU
14:24 < DrItanium> Lies!
14:24 < gradius> hotdogs: im sorry my schedule sucks
14:24 < gradius> :(
14:24 < timtimmah> gradius: fix that shit
14:24 < timtimmah> work mornings
14:24 < hotdogs> gradius: you should show up at 10
14:24 < DrItanium> gradius: What day do you move rooms?
14:24 < hotdogs> but you usually show up at 1 am
14:26 < gradius> DrItanium: had to do it yesterday
14:26 < gradius> i have so much shit
14:26 < DrItanium> lucky...
14:26 < gradius> but at least my room is clean now
14:26 < DrItanium> I don't move until the 18th
14:26 < gradius> buuut
14:27 < gradius> my back hurts lolol.
14:27 < timtimmah> gradius: just throw it off the balcony
14:27 < DrItanium> They didn't let you stay in the same room?
14:27 < timtimmah> or out the window
14:27 < DrItanium> timtimmah: Wut?
14:27 < hotdogs> gradius: you should lift with your legs
14:27 < gradius> DrItanium: I wanted to move to the bigger room in the apartment
14:27 < DrItanium> ah
14:27 < gradius> and that way it forced me to get rid of a lot of old shit
14:27 < gradius> I've been in that room for 2 years
14:27 < gradius> so I've stockpiled a lot of old papers + stuff
14:27 < DrItanium> Well I was able to move the rx5670 back to my parents so that 180 lb beast isn't a problem anymore. My desktop though....
14:27 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:27 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:28 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:28 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:28 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:28 < gradius> hotdogs: I HAVE THEM FOR YOU DONT WORRY
14:28 < hotdogs> gradius: where the fuck are my notes
14:28 < gradius> hotdogs: THEY'RE IN MY ROOM CALM YOUR BALLS
14:28 < hotdogs> ok thank you
14:28 < gradius> are you balls calm now.
14:28 < hotdogs> no
14:29 < gradius> damn
14:30 < hotdogs> they won't be calm until we get a vehicle in dayz
14:30 < gradius> srsly.
14:30 < gradius> and tents.
14:30 < gradius> so are you against playing at 11 tonight?
14:30 < timtimmah> hotdogs: there's vehicles...
14:30 < timtimmah> like bikes
14:30 < hotdogs> so I read that tents disappear 2 days after the owner die
14:30 < gradius> lolol

14:31 < timtimmah> hotdogs: yes
14:32 < timtimmah> watching futurama- amy: Yay, I'm finally done with school! How's the job market? guy-Rough
14:32 < timtimmah> ... it was funnier in my mind
14:34 < prometheusx> that's cause you're crazy
14:37 < hotdogs> timtimmah: was that scruffy
14:43 < gradius> timtimmah: reminds me of the simpsons episode where they're making fun of grad students.
14:43 < gradius> I think it happened a few times actually.
14:46 < gradius> but yeah, I really wanna play DayZ with you guys, I just am with ashley till like 11 this week
14:46 < gradius> (mostly because starting next week I'll be at work till 7 at Riot, and I wont get to see her as much)

00:05 < gradius> hmmmm.
00:05 < gradius> that was a short outage.
00:07 < hotdogs> yes, it's not the one from the email
00:07 < hotdogs> this is just thursday maint window shit
00:07 < gradius> hmm k
00:07 < gradius> I've just never seen that happen, that's all
00:08 < hotdogs> oh yeah, he rebooted resnet
00:08 < hotdogs> you should be watching #swift
00:08 < hotdogs> also, yes, this is the first reboot in a long time
00:08 < hotdogs> old code, nom nom nom
00:08 < gradius> haha
00:08 < gradius> i guess i should watch it
00:39 < zero-one> zero is here
00:55 < hotdogs> where were you
00:56 < zero-one> hanging out with chrislz
02:05 < zero-one> is anyone awake?
02:05 < zero-one> if so, would you like to play a game of LoL?
02:06 < swiss> I'm awake, but n oLoL for me
02:06 < swiss> check out osu! though
02:06 < swiss> it's cool, you could spend tonight learning to play it
02:06 < swiss> then i cna try and dominate you in it tomorrow
08:26 < gradius> yay my first day of big boy work!
08:26 < gradius> k bai
08:33 < alexjandro> noooo
08:33 < alexjandro> come baxk
08:33 < alexjandro> back*
09:08 < swiss> http://mushrooshi.com/pomf.mp3
09:09 < swiss> time for osu!
10:12 < hotdogs> http://i.imgur.com/pYOiH.png
10:12 < hotdogs> day-z is now doom3
10:35 < airen> hotdogs: lold
10:35 < airen> No flashlight though.
10:38 < hotdogs> there's flashlights
10:38 < hotdogs> and they're separate weapons
10:38 < hotdogs> so it's oddly similar to doom3, really
10:38 < hotdogs> the worst part about flashlights right now is that swapping around secondary weapons (which they count as) has a tendency to make items disappear
10:38 < hotdogs> there are also some guns with flashlight attachments
11:16 < swiss> anyone gonna play osu with me?
11:17 < hotdogs> play what
11:17 < swiss> it's like ddr, but the mouse
11:17 < swiss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&list=PL0EC33B912EB629F2&v=vNRHMJUvv0w
11:18 < swiss> i really enjoy it
11:18 < hotdogs> that looks like elite beat agents, I think it's called
11:20 < swiss> yeah, it's like that
11:28 < swiss> there's a lot of anime songs, but there's lots that aren't. You'll have to choose what songs we playt so it's not all anime
11:33 < hotdogs> no thanks
11:33 < hotdogs> I didn't really enjoy elite beat agents
11:34 < hotdogs> and I doubt osu has any music that I would enjoy listening to
11:34 < swiss> there's so many people
11:35 < swiss> search their beatmaps page
11:38 < hotdogs> DON'T CARE
12:25 < zero-one> swiss: not interested
12:25 < zero-one> it you wanna challenge me at stepmania or ITG, that's a different story
12:37 < swiss> meh, osu is easy online though :P

--- Day changed Sun Jun 17 2012
00:14 < swiss> meh
00:29 < timmah> hotdogs: I was afk buying new clothes for the job
00:29 < timmah> gotta look pretty
00:30 < hotdogs> of course
00:30 < hotdogs> I forgot
00:31 < timmah> almost bought a pair of bright red jeans
00:32 < hotdogs> oh man
00:33 < hotdogs> that sounds like effective shopping
00:33 < timmah> I probably could have pulled it off
00:34 < hotdogs> oh you can always pull them off
00:34 < timmah> aww yeah
00:42 < hotdogs> I sorted my steam games list
00:42 < hotdogs> unfinished is so huge
00:42 < timmah> haha
00:42 < timmah> It's kind of dis-heartening isn't it?
00:45 < hotdogs> finished is huge too

00:55 < alexjandro> haha gj
00:56  * timmah &
01:08 < hotdogs> timmah: DAYZ UPDATE OGOMGOGMG
04:54 -!- DrItanium [~itanic@electricabac.us] has quit [Ping timeout: 252 seconds]
09:05 < timmah> AWW YEAH
10:08 < timmah> hotdogs: worst part about burn notice is the obvious dubbing
10:15 < hotdogs> yeah...
10:15 < hotdogs> I'm not sure if I didn't notice it in the first seasons
10:16 < hotdogs> but I think a season or two ago it was happening a lot
10:16 < hotdogs> and it's dying down
10:16 < timmah> I hope they're using better microphones
10:17 < hotdogs> Subject: Aknowledge The Receipt Of the Mail
10:17 < hotdogs> I don't think it's mics
10:17 < hotdogs> it's obvious because their lips don't match up
10:17 < hotdogs> I think it's a tight shooting schedule and/or shooting too much
10:17 < timmah> That was my second idea
10:18 < hotdogs> so they have to chop stuff out in editing...and have to put audio over video that's not really right
10:18 < hotdogs> OR, everyone on the show is a bad actor
10:18 < hotdogs> so the director is just like "fuck it, look the other way and mumble something and wel'l fix it later"
10:19 < timmah> "peas and carrots"
10:19 < timmah> Haha, did you notice the name of the guy's uniform he stole?
10:19 < timmah> B.Hill
10:19 < timmah> Benny?
10:20 < hotdogs> yeah I noticed that too
10:21 < timmah> When do new episodes come out, wednesdays?
10:23 < timmah> no, thursdays.
10:30 < hotdogs> time to turn on my stereo and play some mister crowley
10:31 < timmah> do it
10:35 < hotdogs> done
10:35 < hotdogs> mr crowley makes flossing more enjoyable
10:36 < timmah> I think it makes everything more enjoyable
10:37 < hotdogs> do you think it makes gay sex more enjoyable
10:37 < timmah> "won't you ride my white horse"
10:37 < timmah> it's all ABOUT gay sex
10:38 < alexjandro> hmm i wonder what triggered my highlight in this channel.
10:39 < hotdogs> "won't you ride my white whores"
10:42 < timmah> I think it was horse
10:47 < hotdogs> OH YEAH, FAG?
10:48 < timmah> So I'm thinking of getting a new mouse...
10:48 < timmah> With more buttons.
10:48 < hotdogs> NO, DON'T DO IT
10:50 < hotdogs> welp I'm bored.  What should I do?
10:50 < timmah> hotdogs: http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse
10:50 < timmah> BUTTONS
10:51 < hotdogs> that's absurd
10:51 < timmah> I'm still trying to think of a solution to the press-to-talk conundrum
10:51 < timmah> yeah, it's a silly amount of buttons.
10:53 < timmah> If I could remap that random button on the 518 to something useful
10:54 < hotdogs> the middle one?
10:54 < timmah> yeah, it was supposed to be for windows management or something
10:54 < hotdogs> yeah, that's a bad one for ptt though
10:54 < hotdogs> cause you can't keep doing stuff and holding it
10:55 < timmah> True
10:55 < timmah> But if I could remap it to throw grenade, I could use G for pus to talk
10:55 < hotdogs> but then it gets strange when you use it outside of games
10:56 < timmah> or for typing
10:56 < timmah> hrm.
10:58 < timmah> I'm not using the upper button, maybe that'll be my ptt
10:58 < hotdogs> that's what I do
10:58 < timmah> hng.
10:58 < timmah> then I couldn't melee...
10:59 < timmah> DEBATE
11:01 < timmah> I just need to grow another arm.
11:05 < hotdogs> Yes

15:54 < hotdogs> I might be working this entire weekend.
15:59 < zero-one> oh, right
15:59 < zero-one> http://thedangerbrain.com/controlroom/wp-content/plugins/wp-jquery-lightbox/wp-jquery-lightbox.php
15:59 < zero-one> well that's interesting
16:00 < zero-one> now i know what software they run, and where it is
16:01 < zero-one> let's see what else we can find
16:05 < zero-one> oh, you can try dictionary attacking their cpanel login as well
16:11 < airen> zero-one-kun: Are you *hacking*?!?
16:11 < zero-one> DON'T BE SILLY
16:11 < zero-one> I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING OF THE SORT
16:11 < zero-one> <_<
16:11 < zero-one> >_>
16:11  * zero-one &
16:27 < hotdogs> so I figured out why my mp3s weren't tagged
16:27 < hotdogs> instead of "TITLE", it was "Title", and so on
16:27 < hotdogs> so my auto-converter didn't catch the tags
16:33 < hotdogs> also, the horns in this sound kinda broken...
16:41 < gradius> lolwat
16:41 < gradius> also zero-one be good.
16:41 < gradius> break more shit
16:41 < hotdogs> gradius: how's work
16:41 < timmah> hotdogs: these headphones are funny...
16:41 < hotdogs> do they tickle?
16:41 < timmah> They are made of penis.
16:41 < timmah> It sounds like my earbuds
16:42 < timmah> but way more comfortable
16:42 < gradius> hotdogs: trying to figure out the structure and all the tools they use
16:42 < gradius> and already swapped out my mechanical keyboard
16:42 < gradius> (felt self concious about being the only clack clack on the floor.)
16:42 < gradius> conscious?
16:42 < gradius> idk
16:42 < timmah> gradius: fuck everyone else, wear headphones
16:42 < gradius> timmah: LOL
16:42 < gradius> well when the guy across from me says "you click a lot"
16:43 < gradius> that's means, time to swap keyboards
16:43 < timmah> gradius: say "deal with it.tiff"
16:43 < gradius> gradius.getStatus() = intern
16:43 < gradius> therefore, bad idea.
16:43 < timmah> oh right
16:43 < timmah> LAME
16:44 < timmah> lame like an old horse
16:44 < timmah> hotdogs: give me something to test these headphones with
16:45 < hotdogs> uhhh
16:45 < hotdogs> what, like audio
16:45 < hotdogs> OH
16:45 < hotdogs> OH OH OH
16:45 < hotdogs> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL-8lMCMyQ4
16:46 < gradius> I DONT LIKE SODA BEING 25C
16:46 < gradius> ITS GOING TO MAKE ME FAT
16:46 < gradius> :(
16:46 < gradius> NOT LIKE IM NOT FAT ALREADY
16:46 < timmah> gradius: get a treadmill and use that as your desk
16:47 < timmah> guy next to you: "You walk too much"
16:47 < prometheusx> gradius: ill give you $5 and you can buy me a bunch of soda
16:49 < hotdogs> gradius: they're trying to make you so fat you can't walk out the door
16:49 < hotdogs> SO YOU CAN NEVER LEAVE
16:49 < hotdogs> timmah: did you listen to that song
16:49 < timmah> hotdogs: OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED
16:50 < timmah> DID I JUST GO INTO MY SPEAKER
16:50 < timmah> WHAT THE FUCK
16:50 < hotdogs> YOU ARE NOW UNDER WATER
16:51 < gradius> YOU ARE NOW WATER.
16:52 < timmah> I AM NOW WATER
16:52 < timmah> fapfapfap
16:52 < timmah> That sounded amazing
16:52 < timmah> now to listen to it with speakers
16:53 < timmah> Oh yeah. Way better with headphones
16:53 < hotdogs> that just means your speaker suck
16:53 < hotdogs> do you have them angled in?
16:53 < timmah> gonna try with my old phones in
16:53 < timmah> I do
16:54 < hotdogs> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6BQKFs3-VM
16:55 < timmah> hotdogs: good job breaking your monitor
16:55 < hotdogs> that was nouveau
16:56 < hotdogs> it apparently doesn't like changing modes very much
16:56 < hotdogs> also, my background is all stretched nasty now
16:56 < timmah> time for a new tiled one
16:56 < hotdogs> I guess so
16:57 < hotdogs> I was using big cool ones before though
16:57 < hotdogs> my login one survives resizing decently
16:57 < hotdogs> I bet if I resized by regular background properly it wouldn't look so terrible
16:58 < hotdogs> also, different perspective :(
17:00 < airen> hotdogs: Oh, that's what you mean by login. I use startx. :X
17:01 < hotdogs> aw yeah, livin in the past
17:06 < timmah> hotdogs: I might be bugging you tomorrow after HR if it finishes before noon
17:06 < timmah> zero-one: see? timmah, not timtimmah. You're crazy for thinking I was timtimmah
17:07 < timmah> hotdogs: mainly if I don't have access to my office yet
17:07 < airen> hotdogs: I have no need for a graphical login manager.
17:08 < hotdogs> so do you startx and then switch back to clean up the terminal?
17:08 < hotdogs> also, do you enjoy waiting for the entirety of init
17:09 < gradius> hotdogs: I FUCKING LOVE WATCHING INIT
17:10 < hotdogs> gradius: how's work
17:12 < gradius> Just going through jira stuff, and reading some of their documentation
17:12 < hotdogs> TIME TO START HACKIN' JIRA
17:12 < gradius> Waiting for people to finish their stuff so I can bug them about my newbie projects
17:12 < hotdogs> so what exactly are you doing?
17:12 < hotdogs> security testing or what
17:16 < gradius> Nah, I'm just picking up whatever the security team is giving me. I'm shadowing different people for the next week or so.
17:16 < gradius> the security team does lots of sec related things.
17:17 < alexjandro> really?
17:17 < hotdogs> lololo
17:17 < gradius> yarly
17:17 < gradius> hahahah
17:17 < hotdogs> I guess since you're the intern you get to sample lots of stuff
17:18 < gradius> Yeah, it's more like, "lets see what you like and what you're good at"
17:21 < gradius> holy shit. I just noticed my laptop has 16gb of ram.
17:21 < gradius> w/ an i7
17:21 < gradius> nvidia quadro 1000M
17:21 < gradius> :|
17:21 < gradius> dayum.
17:25 < airen> hotdogs: Init is pretty fast.
17:25 < airen> I don't mind waiting a bit.
17:25 < airen> And I just poweroff from a shell in my xsession. Sometimes I don't even start an x session, usually on my laptop.
17:26 < gradius> airen: but... but... that's not what we believe. you should conform to us.
17:30 < airen> http://bash.org/?737051
17:31 < gradius> LOL
17:32 < hotdogs> airen: just sayin', I start slim kinda early in init.  that really depends on what stuff you need to start though
17:32 < hotdogs> stupid nfs crap
17:32 < airen> hotdogs: You don't background it?
17:32 < hotdogs> not gonna background things that depend on eachother
17:33 < hotdogs> playing dependency commander is one of my less favorite parts of arch init
17:34 < airen> Be like davie and switch to systemd then.
17:34 < hotdogs> arch breaks enough as it is
17:34 < airen> This reminds me, I need to find out why dhcpcd keeps failing on init.
17:40 < prometheusx> http://www.gameranx.com/updates/id/7451/article/dayz-thousands-of-players-banned-over-scripting-drama/
17:41 < hotdogs> "significant amount of the playerbase gone" wat
17:42 < hotdogs> article writer needs to learn how to read
17:44 < timmah> interesting use of the scripting engine
17:58 < gradius> holy shit jira is a mess of features.
17:59 < airen> NOT UNIX
17:59 < airen> KILL IT WITH FIRE
18:12 < gradius> BUT WE'RE SO ENTERPRISE.
18:12 < gradius> :|
18:12 < gradius> not sure what you mean by not unix though
18:13 < airen> I'm mostly just talking out my ass because I'm bored on break.
18:14 < gradius> Woo!
18:14 < gradius> Jira is a crazy ticketing system + bug tracker + ANYTHING ELSE :|
18:19 < hotdogs> any good?
18:24 < gradius> It's pretty cool, but I'm still super overwhelmed. It may be my lack of experience with it, but I'm trying to learn it hah.
18:28 < airen> >written in java
18:28 < airen> >proprietary
18:28 < airen> >nothx.jpg
18:39 < hotdogs> in other news, protip: don't give root to vendors
18:39 < hotdogs> it's like giving root to alexjandro
18:53 < alexjandro> whaaa
18:54 < alexjandro> hotdogs: it's better than giving root to zero-one
18:58 < hotdogs> is it really, though
19:02 < alexjandro> yes
19:04 < hotdogs> I wouldn't give it to either of you

23:16 < zero-one> gradius: READ MAH PMS
23:16 < alexjandro> gradius: run away, he has PMS
23:17 < hotdogs> gradius: fuck that
23:17 < hotdogs> that means they need to do MORE changes!
23:21 < hotdogs> zero-one: also ha ha I left when you were mid sentence

11:40 < zero-one> it took like... an hour to get this far
11:40 < hotdogs> A WHOLE GIGABYTE?
11:41 < zero-one> hotdogs: this hard drive is probably a 5200 RPM, and on top of that, all of the malware and other running shit is making it choke up
11:42 < zero-one> so in this case, a single GB is a big deal
11:42 < zero-one> lol
11:42 < hotdogs> oh right
11:42 < hotdogs> also, just checked, I'm not using mbox
11:42 < hotdogs> aww yeahhh
11:42 < zero-one> haha
11:43 < swiss> zero-one: why are you running their OS?
11:43 < swiss> live cd then copy the emails
11:45 < zero-one> i need them exported in some shitty outlook format
11:50 < swiss> lol
11:52 < zero-one> yeah, it died
11:52 < zero-one> restarting...
11:52 < zero-one> FUUUUUUU
11:53 < swiss> lol

12:00 < gradius> zero-one: :(
14:01 < zero-one> swiss: where's swissbox again?
14:01 < zero-one> i can't find it
14:10 < timmah> hotdogs: zero-one: figured out my cd drive issue
14:10 < swiss> zero-one: what do you mean?
14:10 < swiss> port 2022 on veryoblivio.us
14:11 < zero-one> swiss: you know, that machine in the lab
14:11 < zero-one> where is it
14:11 < swiss> back right-ish
14:11 < swiss> it's a dell latitude d600
14:11 < swiss> sitting on top
14:11 < swiss> looks like shit
14:11 < zero-one> timmah: cool. let me know if you want me to come down there and help at any point
14:11 < swiss> i hope it didn't get jacked :X
14:11 < hotdogs> timmah: what was it
14:13 < timmah> zero-one: willdo
14:13 < timmah> hotdogs: I had disabled the drives in the bios
14:13 < hotdogs> gg
14:13 < timmah> ./wrists
14:15 < timmah> also when thunderbutt pulled, it grabbed thunderbutt-ar also
14:25 < zero-one> swiss: is it the one with mobuntu?
14:26 < swiss> zero-one: no, it's my personal laptop
14:26 < swiss> remember the one with the broken screen?
14:26 < zero-one> oh
14:26 < zero-one> i don't see that piece of shit anywhere
14:26 < swiss> it looks like my normal laptop, but bigger, grey, and shitter
14:26 < swiss> awww, it mighta gotten jacked
14:26 < swiss> not near the switchpanel on the table?
14:26 < swiss> it was on top
14:28 < zero-one> there are lots of latitudes
14:28 < zero-one> but none are the shitty one
14:32 < hotdogs> lololo someone stole your shitty laptop
14:34 < swiss> i don't really care, i was planning on giving it away anyways.... but it's a bit irritating
14:34 < swiss> i mean, it was a d600 or d700
14:34 < swiss> so it wasn't worth anything
14:34 < swiss> I'm surprised it's gone thoguh. I wrote "Personel Laptop: Do not touch or unplug" on it I think
14:35 < prometheusx> why? that's pretty much marking it for stealing
14:35 < zero-one> yeah, that's fucked up
14:35 < swiss> prometheusx: because it kept it from getting overwritten for this long
14:36 < swiss> I may have written "swisstop, do not touch or unplug"
14:37 < prometheusx> ah, making it as a personal one just seems like a bad idea
14:38 < swiss> meh, it was shit anyways
15:30 < hotdogs> "SPECIAL PROJECT, DO NOT TOUCH"
15:31 < hotdogs> leaving anything in that room seems like a bad idea
15:39 < gradius> that room seems like a bad idea
15:39 < prometheusx> well, it is easy to break in to
15:39 < hotdogs> gradius: how's work
15:41 < airen> swiss: Bummer duder.
15:41 < swiss> airen: I didn't have anything installed
15:41 < swiss> and gentoo had issues installing on it so I couldn't even use it for distcc
15:41 < swiss> it was a total shitbox. 20GB hdd as well
15:57 < gradius> hotdogs: pretty fun, I get to do some python for work :)
15:57 < gradius> yay
16:01 < hotdogs> yay
16:02 < hotdogs> writing an official irc bot for riot

00:50 < swiss> http://www.placella.com/software/zenity/zenity-win32.png
10:01 < zero-one> gradius: are there any free and open source tools for making drive backups that you'd recommend?
10:01 < zero-one> if not, are there any paid ones?
10:02 < alexjandro> clonezilla
10:02 < zero-one> alexjandro: you use that?
10:39 < zero-one> hotdogs: timmah: lunch today?
10:54 < alexjandro> zero-one: yes
10:54 < zero-one> alexjandro: burning it to a disc now
10:55 < zero-one> gonna test it out, and hopefully won't have to ask teh boss to buy software
10:55 < alexjandro> yea clonezilla is great
10:55 < alexjandro> and free
10:55 < alexjandro> where are you storing the backups?
10:55 < zero-one> probably flash media
10:55 < alexjandro> do you have like an external USB
10:56 < alexjandro> how big?
10:56 < alexjandro> beause this makes an image of the drive
10:56 < zero-one> alexjandro: not sure... 200GB?
10:56 < alexjandro> 200GB flash drive?
10:56 < zero-one> yeah, i read about it
10:56 < zero-one> alexjandro: no, 200GB HDD
10:56 < zero-one> forget about the flash drive
10:56 < alexjandro> okay
10:57 < alexjandro> then yea, it's great
10:57 < swiss> zero-one: if you still need a backup drive on saturday i have a 250 GB you could borrow
10:57 < swiss> IDE though
10:58 < swiss> then just dd the drives
10:58 < zero-one> swiss: was considering using dd at first, and then clonezilla seemed like a better idea
11:01 < gradius> zero-one: yeah I was going to suggest clonezilla
11:02 < alexjandro> gradius: HAHA BEAT YOU TO IT
11:03 < zero-one> gradius: HAHA HE BEAT YOU TO IT
11:28 < swiss> gradius: AHAHA YOUR BRAIN WORKS LIKE ALEXJANDROS
11:28 < swiss> <3
11:29 < swiss> zero-one: i'd just suggest dd cause I'm more familiar with it
11:35 < airen> dd_rescue
11:39 < zero-one> swiss: try and ask my server for a page that doesn't exist
11:39 < zero-one> zer0-one.net/sdfsdfsdsdf or something
11:40 < prometheusx> zer0-one.net/vagina
11:40 < prometheusx> vagina on fire is bad
11:54 < airen> zero-one: sfw or not?
11:55 < prometheusx> airen: it says shit, that's about it
11:56 < airen> zero-one: mod-rewrite or .htaccess?
12:00 < airen> For a while back when I was on nordicks, I had an open directory on my server with miku pictures.
12:00 < airen> I still get stuff in my apache logs about it.
12:00 < airen> I was tired of that so I did some mod_rewrite stuff myself.
12:01 < airen> Very nsfw though
14:29 < zero-one> airen: it's nginx, so i just added an "error_page" line in the config
14:55 < airen> Ah, I see.
14:59 < zero-one> i did the same thing for 403, but at the moment there isn't really a way you can get a 403
15:01 < airen> I still love nginx for static stuff, but I have to bow to the apache gods when it comes to code evaulation.
15:05 < zero-one> i guess
15:05 < zero-one> one of these days i need to set up apache
16:14 < hotdogs> don't
16:16 < zero-one> hotdogs: why?
16:18 < hotdogs> just telling you not to do anything
16:18 < hotdogs> yes, apache has billions of modules
16:18 < hotdogs> it's painful to move stuff away from it
16:30 < airen> Nginx and apache can be good friends.
16:50 < swiss> off to my aunts house
16:50 < gradius> FORNDS APARCH ND NGNIEX
16:50 < swiss> to fix her compy
16:51 < zero-one> airen: yup, you can use nginx as a reverse proxy for apache servers
16:51 < zero-one> i'd love to try that out
16:51 < airen> Si senor.
17:01 < gradius> god damn it
17:01 < gradius> I finish my most stressful part of my project
17:02 < gradius> and I cant even play lol because our gameserver is down
17:02 < gradius> riot pls
17:09 < zero-one> gradius: PLAY LOL WITH MEEEE
17:14 < hotdogs> I assume he has to play on internal servers with new changes in them
17:56 < gradius> We can play both.
17:56 < gradius> :)
17:56 < gradius> There's a daily play test of new stuff
18:02 < hotdogs> anything good?
18:17 < gradius> nope
18:17 < gradius> not at all

16:07 < swiss> gradius: it's running on my server
16:07 < swiss> cause the box, when it boots up (rc.boot) initiates a reverse ssh connection to my server
16:08 < swiss> pushing itself to port 3022
16:43 < gradius> ahhh
16:43 < gradius> I dont think anyone will leave it on for too long if they see linux sadly :(
16:45 < swiss> yeah, but I just need an IP address
16:45 < swiss> just one second for the connection will be enough
17:25 < hotdogs> I wonder if they have a lost and found
17:25 < hotdogs> and someone moved it there

22:07 < alexjandro> hotdogs: wait does that mean no beach for you?
22:08 < zero-one> alexjandro: unfortunately, yes

23:40 < hotdogs> weirdo
23:40 < zero-one> hm...
23:41 < zero-one> how do i send mail using my cal poly address
23:41 < zero-one> hotdogs: also, can you get mail coming from zer0-one.net to stop going to the spam filter?
23:42 < zero-one> there's never even been any spam send through it
23:42 < zero-one> *sent
23:42 < hotdogs> lol
23:43 < hotdogs> I just sent myself an email from zer0-one.net, what's your problem
23:43 < zero-one> uh..
23:43 < zero-one> no you didn't
23:44 < hotdogs> sending mail using a cpp address is as simple as sending an email with your cpp address as the from address
23:44 < hotdogs> what's your email?
23:44 < zero-one> hotdogs: you're misunderstanding me
23:44 < zero-one> i'm not trying to send email using a cal poly address through my server
23:45 < zero-one> i'm just saying, i think i might be hitting the spam filter
23:45 < hotdogs> check your cpp email
23:45 < hotdogs> I hope that's your email, anyway
23:45 < zero-one> hotdogs: did you connect to zer0-one.net from campus?
23:46 < hotdogs> no
23:46 < zero-one> what's your ip at home? my shitty rules might have let you through
23:47 < hotdogs> lolwat
23:47 < hotdogs> I didn't send mail to zer0-one.net
23:47 < zero-one> i know, fucker
23:47 < zero-one> i'm not stupid
23:47 < hotdogs> then why would I connect to it
23:48 < zero-one> i thought you just said you relayed mail through my server without any kind of auth
23:48 < hotdogs> nope
23:49 < zero-one> so you sent an email with a different from address
23:49 < zero-one> big whoop
23:49 < hotdogs> no
23:49 < zero-one> this is COMPLETELY beside the point
23:49 < hotdogs> give me an email address
23:49 < zero-one> hotdogs: i know what you're doing, i've done it before
23:49 < hotdogs> yes
23:50 < zero-one> now how the FUCK, do i send email that originates from cal poly's server
23:50 < zero-one> that was my original question
23:50 < hotdogs> how do you send mail that originates from cpp?
23:51 < hotdogs> bounce it off of smtp.csupomona.edu?
23:51 < zero-one> dear god nevermind
23:51 < hotdogs> what do you want
23:52 < hotdogs> you are not providing a consistent description of the scenario
23:52 < zero-one> i need to stop thinking out loud
23:53 < hotdogs> if your mails are getting rejected, you should check the mail logs
23:53 < zero-one> basically, i just want some webmail interface thing that lets me send email from cal poly
23:54 < hotdogs> like OWA?
23:54 < zero-one> yes
23:54 < zero-one> like that
23:54 < hotdogs> except...off-campus?
23:54 < zero-one> no
23:54 < zero-one> on campus
23:54 < hotdogs> so OWA
23:54 < zero-one> the link on the main page brings me to login.live.com
23:54 < zero-one> what credentials am i supposed to use there?
23:55 < hotdogs> ones you set in mycontrolpanel, I think
23:55 < hotdogs> they might have to be separate
23:56 < hotdogs> you could also send emails using a real client or whatever against smtp.csupomona.edu using your network password
23:56 < hotdogs> and if you can't send mail, it's probably getting bounced by the MXs for being some random new domain since they're all about reputation and shit
23:57 < hotdogs> also, possibly broken forward/reverse dns, not being the MX record, etc etc
23:58 < zero-one> finally found the fucking password options
23:58 < zero-one> ok, there we go

15:36 < prometheusx> hotdogs: http://i.imgur.com/eu1xM.png get this movie and pirates 2 so we can have a movie night
20:11 < hotdogs> timmah: man, now I'm totally like "oh I should watch some more futurama episodes"
20:11 < hotdogs> but there are none
23:28 < timmah> hotdogs: just go forward in time an hour
23:28 < timmah> er, week not hour
23:35 -!- sunrisewolf [~someone@fluffy.unx.csupomona.edu] has joined #testgradius
23:35 < sunrisewolf> is anyone on?
23:38 < hotdogs> no
23:38 < sunrisewolf> I'm a frustrated idiot who can't figure out irssi
23:39 < sunrisewolf> I tried connecting from my linux and it ruined whatever setup someone created for me
23:39 < sunrisewolf> I mean I still got my theme and  stuff
23:40 < sunrisewolf> but I manually connected
23:40 < sunrisewolf> er
23:40 < sunrisewolf> I mean I don't want to manually connect
23:42 < hotdogs> you mean if you close it you can't reconnect
23:42 < hotdogs> or...you have to
23:43 < sunrisewolf> I can't reconnect to my screen session
23:44 < sunrisewolf> if I try it closes
23:44 < alexjandro> what do you close
23:45 < alexjandro> To detach your screen session, it's Ctrl + a then press d
23:47 < sunrisewolf> okay
23:48 < sunrisewolf> but once that's done how to I reattach to my old one?
23:48 < airen> sunrisewolf: screen -rd
23:48 < airen> sunrisewolf: if you have more than one session screen --list (i think)
23:48 < sunrisewolf> yeah two show up
23:49 < airen> Well, there you are then.
23:49 < airen> connect to whichever one you want.
23:49 < airen> Kill the other one.
23:51 < sunrisewolf> I have no idea how to resume any of them
23:52 < hotdogs> screen -rd <name of session>
23:55 < sunrisewolf> none of them work
23:55 < sunrisewolf> they all say "attaching from screen inside of screen?"
23:55 < airen> detach your current session first.
23:55 < sunrisewolf> isn't it? -_-
23:55 < airen> Apparently not.
23:56 < sunrisewolf> there's no screen bar at the bottom and it says etached
23:56 < sunrisewolf> where the hell is the screen?
--- Day changed Sun Jun 24 2012
00:01 < airen> Just because there isn't a hard status line doesn't mean you're not using screen.
00:01 < airen> But I don't know the specifics.
00:03 < sunrisewolf> how do I kill screen sessions?
00:08 < sunrisewolf> found it
00:09 < sunrisewolf> so I kill all of them
00:09 < sunrisewolf> type screen
00:09 < sunrisewolf> and putty closes
00:12 < airen> wakarimasen
00:13 < sunrisewolf> :/
00:13 < sunrisewolf> five hours of frustration and nothing making sense in linux
00:13 < airen> sho ga nai ne?
00:18 < sunrisewolf> yeah
00:18 < sunrisewolf> suppose it is
00:18 < airen> sunrisewolf: TAKE HEART
00:18 < airen> AX IS LESS THAN A WEEK AWAY
00:18 < sunrisewolf> lol whoopdedoo
00:18 < sunrisewolf> paycheck isn't until 2 weeks
00:19 < sunrisewolf> so I probably won't go
00:19 < sunrisewolf> :/
00:19 < airen> sux2beu
00:19 < sunrisewolf> how do you make yourself feel better when you just feel worthless
00:19 < airen> Masturbate.
00:20 < airen> Not even kidding.
00:20 < airen> Works for a bit.
00:20 < sunrisewolf> that just makes you apathetic and tired
00:20 < sunrisewolf> for a bit
00:20 < sunrisewolf> eh
00:20 < airen> Yeah.
00:20 < airen> Eh, takes long term work usually.
00:20 < airen> There are no quick fixes.
00:20 < airen> That's the honest/shitty answer.
00:21 < sunrisewolf> I want to learn
00:22 < sunrisewolf> but nothing is happening
00:22 < airen> What do you mean?
00:22 < sunrisewolf> linux/computers
00:22 < airen> Ah.
00:22 < airen> Takes time.
00:22 < airen> You can't learn everything in a few weeks.
00:22 < airen> How long have you been seriously studying it?
00:22 < airen> Not terribly long I venture.
00:22 < sunrisewolf> time x nothing = nothing
00:22 < airen> When others around you have years of experience.
00:23 < sunrisewolf> But the way I learn I need to bounce idea's and qestions off of someone
00:23 < sunrisewolf> So by myself
00:24 < sunrisewolf> with all of the guides
00:24 < sunrisewolf> upon guids
00:24 < sunrisewolf> guides*
00:24 < sunrisewolf> upon more guides
00:24 < sunrisewolf> won't get me anywhere
00:24 < airen> Well, you do have #swift.
00:24 < airen> But it's easier when there is someone there in person.
00:24 < sunrisewolf> since when does anyone help in #swift except make fun of you for not knowing?
00:25 < airen> Because often in this sort of situation, the person having the problem doesn't know enough to adaquately explain the problem.
00:25 < sunrisewolf> well then there you go
00:25 < airen> sunrisewolf: Yeah, #swift is full of trolls and I'm one of them.
00:25 < airen> But they're also usually pretty helpful people.
00:25 < sunrisewolf> I know that everyone in there is helpful airen
00:25 < airen> You just have to take the beating first.
00:26 < airen> I think the situation I described is probably more of what's affecting you (effect?)
00:26 < sunrisewolf> but when I've already beaten myself
00:26 < sunrisewolf> for hours
00:26 < sunrisewolf> it's not really that great
00:26 < sunrisewolf> of an option
00:26 < airen> That's the culture. Take it or leave it pretty much.
00:26 < airen> Which is why you asked here I suppose.
00:26 < airen> This channel is usually more friendly.
00:27 < airen> I don't have much help for you really because I never use putty.
00:27 < sunrisewolf> Not as many of the older members.
00:27 < airen> My windows knowledge is close to nil these days.
00:27 < sunrisewolf> Well I don't know if my issue is putty
00:27 < airen> I don't either.
00:27 < sunrisewolf> I want to connect from linux
00:27 < airen> But that's one element that I can't really help you debug.
00:28 < sunrisewolf> but it's like it's corrupted
00:28 < airen> Pastebin me some output? Maybe I can help you get to the bottom of this.
00:28 < alexjandro> like what is corrupted?
00:29 < sunrisewolf> I'd have to reboot into linux
00:29 < sunrisewolf> I suppose I could get on webirc
00:29 < sunrisewolf> like my dfwaldron@login.csupomona.edu is corrupted
00:30 < sunrisewolf> whatever that is
00:30 < alexjandro> well that puts you in either fluffy or garrison, i think
00:30 < airen> sunrisewolf: Is it not connecting?
00:30 < alexjandro> so you may have set it up one and now you're logging into the other
00:30 < hotdogs> not it
00:30 < prometheusx> sunrisewolf: you know there are two servers you can go to when logging in to cpp right?
00:31 < sunrisewolf> shouldn't it work on either?
00:31 < prometheusx> nope
00:31 < hotdogs> she's on fluffy twice
00:31 < prometheusx> it was a problem i hit when i was first using the cpp servers, i had to ssh to garrison i think to reattach my screen
00:31 < alexjandro> how is she on there twice?
00:31 < sunrisewolf> [remote power detached]
00:31 < sunrisewolf> Screen session of $LOGNAME $:cr:$:nl:ended.
00:31 < sunrisewolf> Connection to login.csupomona.edu closed.
00:32 < sunrisewolf> I'm on twice because I have two putty sessions open on windows
00:32 < airen> sunrisewolf: pow-detach is ctrl-a-D instead of ctrl-a-d
00:32 < airen> That'll log you out and detach.
00:32 < airen> The latter just detaches.
00:33 < prometheusx> you should try screen -ls on both fluffy and garrison, see how many screens you got running
00:33 < sunrisewolf> I only connect to fluffy from windows
00:33 < sunrisewolf> dfwaldron@fluffy.unx.csupomona.edu
00:34 < sunrisewolf> so connecting to it from garrison might have messed it up?
00:35 < sunrisewolf> airen: ctrl-a-D starts the detach but doesn't do anything
00:35 < airen> sunrisewolf: It's supposed to detach AND log you out.
00:36 < sunrisewolf> so garrison and fluffy show NO screens running now
00:36 < airen> Which means you killed them all.
00:37 < sunrisewolf> But then putty closes when I open screen
00:37 < sunrisewolf> So it opens the screen session I want
00:37 < hotdogs> note: if you're trying to connect to a screen from yesterday, it is dead.  You have my condolences
00:37 < sunrisewolf> (i think)
00:37 < sunrisewolf> when did it die?
00:37 < airen> sunrisewolf: What command do you give it? just "screen" or something else?
00:38 < hotdogs> around 10am
00:38 < sunrisewolf> 10am?
00:38 < sunrisewolf> just scren
00:38 < sunrisewolf> screen*
00:38 < hotdogs> nevermind me
00:40 < alexjandro> sunrisewolf: so all you do is log in, run 'screen', and your putty closes?
00:40 < sunrisewolf> no
00:41 < sunrisewolf> As of right now, if I open a new putty session
00:41 < sunrisewolf> it will close right away
00:41 < sunrisewolf> then if I connect again
00:41 < sunrisewolf> it will connect to screen inside of screen
00:44 < airen> Odd.
00:48 < prometheusx> are you using saved setings in putty? are there any commands that are run when you login with those saved settings?
00:51 < swiss> hallo
00:52 < airen> swiss: AX SOON :D
00:52 < swiss> airen: I AM SO EXCITED
00:52 < airen> o/
00:52 < swiss> I've found a source of cash too!
00:52 < swiss> \o
00:52 < swiss> airen: btw, you get the swapnote I sent you?
00:53 < airen> swiss: Not yet.
00:54 < swiss> airen: hmmm, i might resend
00:54 < airen> Lemme check.
00:54 < airen> Just got back.
00:54 < airen> Haven't fucked with my 3ds
00:54 < swiss> ah, i sent it earlier today
00:54 < airen> So spotpass may have updated.
00:55 < airen> swiss: Yeah, just got it.
00:55 < swiss> ;)
00:55 < swiss> you like the 3d feature on the picture too?
00:56 < airen> swiss: zomg lolin
00:56 < zero-one> gradius: swiss: chrislz: LoL time
00:56 < swiss> I didn't realize the spotpass note could be so fun
00:56 < swiss> zero-one: maybe, i have to update it then
00:57 < airen> swiss: swapnote is gerat.
00:57 < airen> *great
00:57 < swiss> I don't know if I've unlocked all the features yet
00:57 < swiss> I just got voice
00:59 < airen> You haven't. ;)
00:59 < swiss> I googled it :X
00:59 < swiss> still need more stationary and date stamp
01:00 < swiss> and I haven't even finsihed one puzzle yet on the streetpass game
01:00 < alexjandro> airen: ;)
01:00 < airen> alexjandro: TOO BROWN FOR ME
01:00 < swiss> airen: sorry, no nearby 2.9d
01:01 < airen> swiss: oft a problem
01:02 < swiss> met a new one the other day
01:02 < swiss> more like 2.95d though
01:02 < swiss> a friend invited me over to swim with her
01:02 < swiss> and then she had a friend
01:02 < swiss> and that friend was 2.95d
01:03 < hotdogs> wat
01:03 < swiss> hotdogs: asian girls aren't quite 3d
01:04 < hotdogs> why not
01:04 < swiss> because
01:04 < swiss> airen can explain
01:05 < hotdogs> a flat 3d object is still a 3d object
01:05 < swiss> hotdogs: comparing them to anime characters
01:05 < swiss> which are 2d
01:05 < hotdogs> are you saying anime artists can't render depth
01:06 < airen> hotdogs: It's just an inside joke.
01:06 < hotdogs> well obviously
01:06 < swiss> hotdogs: accept it
01:07 < hotdogs> accept what
01:07 < swiss> that 2.9d means asian chicks
01:07 < hotdogs> why can't it mean asian dudes
01:07 < hotdogs> they look the same
01:07 < swiss> maybe it can, but nobody cares about asian dudes really
01:09 < hotdogs> I'm not convinced
01:18 < swiss> bummer
01:30 < sunrisewolf> asian dudes are too pretty
01:30 < sunrisewolf> most anyways
01:30 -!- airen [~airen@airencracken.com] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
01:30 < sunrisewolf> they just don't look manly
01:31 < hotdogs> that's kind of a strange notion
01:35 < hotdogs> "manly" ends up sounding more like it just means european
01:35 < hotdogs> I mean, since the majority of male humans are chinese
01:36 < hotdogs> they might be rice farmers though, I bet those guys are pretty tough looking
01:36 < hotdogs> though they might be kind of lean...
01:37 < hotdogs> I have the same thoughts though
01:37 < hotdogs> really, it's the scariest part about liking asian girls.  having ugly sons
01:38 < swiss> asian men can look manly
01:38 < swiss> but they need scars
01:38 < hotdogs> can they look attractive?
01:38 < swiss> and can't have any hair
01:39 < hotdogs> also, they have to be in anime
01:39 -!- airen [~airen@electricabac.us] has joined #testgradius
01:39 < hotdogs> maybe the plight of the asian man is that he's got the same young-forever shit as asian women
01:39 < hotdogs> but that just fucks him over
01:40 < sunrisewolf> haha perhaps it is that they are shorter than me
01:41 < sunrisewolf> the taller asians I dont recall thinking they weren't
01:41 < hotdogs> fuck you, heightist
01:42 < hotdogs> heightism is bizarrely pervasive
01:42 < hotdogs> like racism x 100
01:42 < hotdogs> and no one really notices
01:44 < airen> hotdogs: You notice because you're short.
01:44 < airen> I'm not terribly tall either.

14:46 < zero-one> hay gurl
15:06 < timmah> gaaayyyy
15:25 < gradius> timmah: YES BUT FABULOUS.
15:25 < timmah> gradius: I do not deny such things
15:26 < gradius> timmah: exactly.
15:27 < timmah> gradius: <3
15:34 < prometheusx> homos
15:34 < timmah> prometheusx: you want some of my lovemeat?
15:35 < gradius> prometheusx: want some cat meat? good taco.
15:36 < prometheusx> im tired of mexican food!
15:40 < prometheusx> gradius: found a book on powershell remoting
16:42 < gradius> nom
16:42 < gradius> linkz plz
16:42 < gradius> pm to me
18:28 < prometheusx> gradius: http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_V:_Dawnguard#Vampire_Lord
18:41 < hotdogs> the skyrim skill tree is a bag of dicks
18:43 < zero-one> nay, a whole cart-full of dicks
18:44 < prometheusx> did know they were adding werewolf skills
18:45 < prometheusx> didn't
18:50 < hotdogs> I played a mage
18:50 < hotdogs> it was totally cool
18:50 < hotdogs> "hey guys, let's not give you any significant ways to increase spell damage"
18:52 < prometheusx> weren't there spell damage enchants?
18:54 < hotdogs> hmmmm
18:55 < hotdogs> yes, you could get armor that had bonus damage
18:55 < hotdogs> but you didn't have a wand or orb or staff or anything
18:56 < hotdogs> whereas all the other damage skills had bows/swords/etc
18:56 < hotdogs> actually, I don't think you could increase it with enchanting
18:57 < hotdogs> you could reduce spell cost, I think, but not increase damage
18:58 < hotdogs> whereas you could use smithing to make a grandmaster weapon and sharpen it or whatever, then enchant it...then add buffs to your armor
18:58 < hotdogs> this led to my mage maxing out his damage potential early, then leveing was depressing because everything got harder but my character stayed shitty
19:03 < gradius> so.
19:03 < gradius> who's home?
19:03 < gradius> and who wants to play a game of LoL?
19:03 < gradius> :)

18:01 < zero-one> i haven't done competition gaming for a while now
18:01 < zero-one> lol, i still have my "King Of Noobs" shirt from stomping a bunch of teams in a Black Ops tournament

18:14 < gradius> but I was talking about LoL

19:11 < gradius> that was a hodge podge, "we need this now" sort of app.
19:12 < zero-one> gradius: i might write one in C# and add a GUI
19:13 < zero-one> I bet they'll like that

19:13 < zero-one> omg
19:13 < gradius> oh hell yes they would

19:18 < zero-one> it didn't spontaneously stop working
19:18 < zero-one> i'll bet that the machine doesn't have an internet connection or something
19:18 < zero-one> i lost connectivity a few days ago for no reason
19:18 < zero-one> that might have happened again
19:19 < zero-one> we also played around with the ethernet cables

17:19 < gradius> Find a solution to it.
17:19 < gradius> encrypted database was a good one.
17:25 < zero-one> yeah, that's what i'm thinking

19:08 < zero-one> hotdogs: i need help
19:09 < hotdogs> sexually?
19:09 < zero-one> yes, but not right now
19:09 < gradius> i need help sexually
19:09 < zero-one> i'm reading the gentoo guide to setting up LUKS
19:09 < hotdogs> gradius: I can tell
19:10 < zero-one> and it has me create partitions before anything else
19:10 < zero-one> i thought that the reason i wiped the HDD with random data was to obscure where partitions begin and end
19:10 < zero-one> but can't someone just read the GPT or MBR?
19:11 < hotdogs> it's not to hide the partitions
19:11 < hotdogs> it's to hide the data in the partitions
19:11 < hotdogs> since encrypted data appears to be random
19:11 < hotdogs> if you store encrypted data in a randomized partition, it just looks like more random
19:11 < hotdogs> instead of 0x0000000000deadbeef000000000000
19:12 < zero-one> ooooh
19:12 < timmah> fffff it keeps hilighting partitions
19:12 < zero-one> gos that makes so much more sense
19:12 < zero-one> *god
19:18 < hotdogs> Yes
19:18 < hotdogs> hiding partitions would be a chicken-egg kinda thing
19:18 < hotdogs> at least with BIOS, since BIOS is dumb
19:19 < hotdogs> I wonder if you could install an EFI bit to use your raw device as an encrypted volume...

08:53 < hotdogs> timmah: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dodOGBLEqT0&feature=youtu.be
08:54 < timmah> saw that
08:55 < timmah> lol'd
08:55 < timmah> pretty clever
08:56 < hotdogs> so whatcha doin'
08:56 < timmah> probably going to make breakfast
08:57 < timmah> maybe sk after that
08:57 < hotdogs> :(
08:57 < hotdogs> now you're making me want to play it
08:57 < hotdogs> to catch up
08:58 < timmah> you should, it just sucks you're stuck at the grinding phase
08:59 < hotdogs> it's also too bad I'm using steam because that makes it not possible to play in linux :(
08:59 < timmah> It's just java, I think you can play it from the web
08:59 < hotdogs> the way you login from steam though
09:00 < hotdogs> it's not just your steam credentials
09:00 < timmah> oh okay
09:01 < hotdogs> "Note: If you are running Linux, please note that because Steam does not run on Linux, binding your web account to Steam is not a good idea."
09:02 < hotdogs> I don't have a mic in linux anyway
09:03 < hotdogs> timmah: do the UI sounds only come out of one channel for you?
09:03 < timmah> that sounds familiar
09:03 < timmah> but I turned off most sounds from that game
09:03 < hotdogs> yeah who needs UI sounds
09:03 < timmah> no music/ui
09:03 < timmah> very low effects
09:04 < hotdogs> LOW EFFECTS?!?!
09:04 < hotdogs> does that make them smaller
09:04 < timmah> er, not visual
09:04 < timmah> audio
09:04 < hotdogs> oh, yeah
09:04 < hotdogs> it won't let me log in
09:05 < timmah> servers might be down
09:06 < timmah> their wiki is currently
09:08 < timmah> yeah, "This game is not currently open to the public."
09:09 < hotdogs> how am I supposed to catch up
09:09 < timmah> Wait until the servers are up and play.
09:10 < timmah> Also harass zero-one to play more
09:15 < hotdogs> I think he's willing
09:15 < hotdogs> I'm the lazy one
09:17 < timmah> I know.
09:17 < timmah> The grind is more fun when you have other people to talk to about it
09:30 < hotdogs> yeah, if it's just zero-one though....
09:34 < timmah> I'm down to drop with you guys
09:34 < timmah> Just let me know when
09:37 < hotdogs> I shouldn't make jokes at zero-one's expense, he will probably shoot me
09:54 < hotdogs> timmah: "Last night Amazon's EC2 servers that are responsible for hosting Spiral Knights became affected by a storm in the area that shut all game servers down, forums, etc. This power outage seemed to have affected other online services which use Amazon EC2 as well, such as Netflix and Instagram. "
09:55 < hotdogs> oh
09:55 < hotdogs> "All Spiral Knights servers should now be back online. "
09:55 < hotdogs> that was posted a half hour ago
09:55 < hotdogs> but I still can't get in :(
09:57 < hotdogs> oh, had to restart steam
10:03 < timmah> now we just need zero-one 
10:07 < timmah> wanna tribes until then?
10:51 < zero-one> timmah: i'm up for sk or tribes
10:51 < zero-one> give me a few minutes to get out of bed
10:52 < timmah> zero-one: no worries, take your time
10:52 < timmah> I'm gonna get lunch
10:53 < timmah> Oh, and hotdogs has a fapathon at 12:30
10:53 < timmah> so maybe sk tonight?
11:42 < hotdogs> maybe
11:42 < zero-one> FUCKING PHONE
11:42 < zero-one> ARRRGGHHH
11:42 < prometheusx> beep boop boop beep
11:43 < zero-one> prometheusx: i can't get it to flash correctly
11:43 < zero-one> i'm getting like.. file-not-found errors while trying to chmod and rm certain things
11:55 < prometheusx> what are you flashing?
11:56 < zero-one> CM9
11:56 < zero-one> yeah, it looks like it's looking at the wrong partitions
11:56 < prometheusx> did davie say he had problems with that or just the bootstrap?
11:57 < zero-one> nah, he just had problems getting safestrap to come up
11:57 < zero-one> which i didn't
11:57 < zero-one> but instead, since the gods need to have their fun, i got the other problem

20:11 < alexjandro> zero-one: c'mon even I was able to flash my phone
20:12 < zero-one> alexjandro: because the process you went through is exactly the same as mine, right?
20:12 < zero-one> please, do impart some of your knowledge
20:13 < alexjandro> let me see the guide youre following?
20:14 < zero-one> i'm not following a guide anymore
20:15 < zero-one> right now, the only thing left to do is flash CM9
20:15 < zero-one> and it appears to work, but i get nothing when i boot
20:18 < alexjandro> So you do the BootStrap Recovery thing and the chose the CM9 zip?
20:19 < zero-one> safestrap
20:19 < alexjandro> You lost me
20:19 < alexjandro> have fun

10:35 < gradius> im retarded.
10:35 < gradius> this WHOLE time I had apache up
10:35 < gradius> it wasn't taking the .htaccess files into consideration
10:35 < gradius> :|
10:35 < gradius> I thought I set that up a LONG time ago.
10:57 < prometheusx> gradius: I THINK YOU'RE AWESOME!
11:25 < timmah> hotdogs: zero-one: almost food time
11:29 < gradius> prometheusx: nope :(
11:32 < zero-one> timmah: i don't think i can
11:32 < zero-one> been spending too much money from my checking account
11:32 < zero-one> i'm seriously starting to get worried
11:33 < zero-one> it'd be alright if i didn't have to worry about the deposit on that house
11:33 < zero-one> but i need to basically give the guy like.. $800 up front
11:35 < timmah> zero-one: no worries at all
11:35 < timmah> Yeah, just jumping into a new place to rent is pricy
11:36 < zero-one> gonna see how many hours i can squeeze in this week without getting yelled at
11:36 < zero-one> lol
11:38 < prometheusx> zero-one: get swiss, jt, and chrislz to put in the depsit?
11:39 < zero-one> prometheusx: it's about $800 up front for each of us
11:39 < zero-one> that's the deposit plus first month's rent
11:39 < prometheusx> oh, got it
11:40 < zero-one> all in all, i have about $1000 left to my name
11:41 < zero-one> *PUSH IT TO THE LIMIT*
11:41 < zero-one> *whipe crack*
11:41 < zero-one> *whip
11:43 < prometheusx> time to whore yourself out

12:37 < gradius> perty awesome
12:37 < gradius> haha
18:34 < swiss> zero-one: i'll try and get the money tomorrow from my dad.
18:35 < zero-one> swiss: alright. saree is kinda iffy though
18:35 < zero-one> i don't know if she's actually gonna go through with it
18:35 < swiss> k
18:35 < swiss> what happens if she doesn't?
18:35 < zero-one> then everything falls apart unless we find someone else
18:36 < swiss> hmmmm
18:37 < zero-one> which basically means we talk her into doing it for sure
18:37 < zero-one> then again, it might just be that she's being cautious
18:37 < zero-one> and she really is going to do it
18:37 < swiss> well, i'd liek this kinda figured out
18:37 < swiss> lol
18:38 < zero-one> swiss: i would too
18:38 < swiss> you at least know you could extend where you're currently living if it came to that
18:38 < swiss> I have 0 places planned if this falls through
18:38 < zero-one> swiss: there's an extra room where i'm living
18:38 < zero-one> if this fails, we still get to be roommates
18:38 < zero-one> lol
18:38 < swiss> lol
18:39 < zero-one> but swifthouse is a much better idea
18:41 < zero-one> saree said something about having over 300 pairs of shoes, and lots of clothes
18:41 < swiss> O_o
18:41 < zero-one> and she's worried about where she's going to put it all
18:41 < zero-one> dude, at 300 pairs you need to stop worrying about storage and start worrying about your sanity
18:42 < zero-one> but anyway
18:42 < zero-one> all she needs is some convincing i think
18:42 < swiss> kk
18:42  * zero-one gets the convincing rod
18:42 < swiss> that better not be your penis, cause that's not very convincing
18:42  * swiss is sorry, he had to
18:42 < zero-one> HEEEEEYYYY
18:42 < zero-one> lolol
18:43 < zero-one> but yeah, ask her what her plans are, since we need to have this figured out soon
18:43 < zero-one> do you have her number?
18:43 < zero-one> if so, call her or text her
18:45 < zero-one> ARMAHGAWRD WE ONLY HAVE A MONTH
18:45 < zero-one> to get our shit together
18:45 < swiss> you ready to play against my new card covers?
18:45 < swiss> they add +10 luck to my play style
18:45 < zero-one> lol
18:45 < zero-one> you mean +10 hax
18:46 < swiss> exactly :P
18:46 < swiss> I beat airen with them already
18:47 < swiss> but he was playing off what was basically a draft deck
18:47 < swiss> and would have beat me if I didn't have massive regenerate
18:47 < zero-one> swiss: is there anything else regarding housing that i might be forgetting?
18:48 < swiss> erm.... how much stuff is included with the house?
18:48 < swiss> do we need to find a fridge? All furniture?
18:48 < zero-one> swiss: afaik we need to bring in our own furniture and fridge
18:48 < zero-one> i have a dining table
18:49 < zero-one> and i don't remember if someone is still bringing us a couch
18:49 < swiss> I can possibly bring a couch. That's sketchy though. I'll have a TV, gaming chairs (cause my dad doesn't want them in our house)
18:49 < zero-one> the main thing to worry about is the fridge though
18:49 < swiss> I now have stuff to decorate the walls, but I have a feeling you're gonna want me to keep it in my room :P
18:49 < swiss> yeah, too bad we couldn't grab the one jbest was giving away
18:50 < zero-one> swiss: i think it'd be cool if we just plastered the wall with whatever the fuck we want
18:50 < swiss> i mean the fact it's all anime stuff
18:50 < zero-one> yeah, sure, just keep it relatively close to your room
18:51 < zero-one> hm.. ok, so fridge. what else to worry about?
18:51 < swiss> zero-one: stuff like http://www.rightstuf.com/1-800-338-6827/catalogmgr/sKxHO80inqfeFNlmwE/browse/item/94835/4/0/0
18:51 < swiss> signed by the full cast now
18:51 < swiss> well, almost full cast
18:51 < zero-one> swiss: focus, focus
18:52 < zero-one> important things to consider
18:52 < swiss> Fridge, microwave, pots/pans (i might have that covered)
18:52 < swiss> is a dishwasher included?
18:52 < zero-one> yeah, there's a dishwasher
18:52 < zero-one> but i'm not gonna use it
18:52 < zero-one> i wash my dishes by hand
18:52 < zero-one> don't trust that fucking machine
18:53 < swiss> .... you use a dishwasher to sanitize really
18:53 < swiss> you knock off all the food and give it a once over by hand
18:53 < zero-one> oh
18:53 < zero-one> oh, well if that's what they're for
18:53 < zero-one> yeah, that;s cool
18:53 < swiss> then put it in the dishwasher, which gets hot enough to sanatize
18:54 < swiss> i dunno if I'll be bringing a grill
18:54 < zero-one> swiss: do you know when fall financial aid gets disbursed
18:54 < swiss> if I do it's a small coal grill
18:54 < swiss> nope, i don't get financial aid
18:55 < zero-one> hm...
18:55 < swiss> are bedframes/anything like that included?
18:55 < zero-one> nope
18:56 < swiss> k
18:56 < swiss> we might need to get lighting (lamps, etc)
18:57 < zero-one> uh...
18:57 < zero-one> maybe
18:57 < zero-one> i think i remember lights
18:57 < zero-one> built into the ceiling
18:57 < zero-one> not sure
18:57 < swiss> k
18:58 < swiss> i'll prob need to bring a bookcase
18:58 < zero-one> try thinking of something more serious that we might be forgetting
18:59 < swiss> dunno
19:00 < zero-one> hopefully that's a good sign
19:00 < zero-one> lol
19:00 < hotdogs> don't forget the sex swing
19:00 < zero-one> i'm playing it pretty close financially, so i need to have things planned out far in advance
19:37 < timmah> zero-one: goodwill is your friend
19:37 < timmah> as is gregslist
19:38 < hotdogs> is greg craig's gay brother
19:38 < timmah> Oh my
19:39 < hotdogs> also, where are you guys
19:39 < hotdogs> I rushed home to play games
20:22 < prometheusx> zero-one: washer and drier? also i thought saree was in france for a month
20:40 < zero-one> guess it wasn't a month
20:40 < zero-one> she's back now
22:03 < swiss> zero-one: these are ready for the walls of swifthaus (or at least my room) http://imgur.com/a/h3aeG
22:17 < zero-one> swiss: oh gawd
22:18 < swiss> zero-one: <3
22:18 < prometheusx> swiss: put those up in the entry way
22:19 < swiss> prometheusx: it'll attract all the women
22:19 < prometheusx> the panties will be wet and fall to the floor
22:22 < swiss> just like on that wall scroll
22:48 < hotdogs> gradius:
22:50 < prometheusx> gradius: get jelly bean!
23:09 < zero-one> oh fuck me
23:09 < zero-one> the dude just emailed me saying he wants 3 months worth of rent as a deposit
23:10 < zero-one> since we're all students and probably have no credit
23:10 < alexjandro> haha
23:10 < zero-one> fucking damn it
23:10 < zero-one> well there goes that
23:14 < zero-one> swiss: got any ideas before i try to bargain with him?
23:14 < swiss> zero-one: what's your financial situation like?
23:15 < swiss> I doubt you could do that, but maybe pay 2 months deposit, then installments for final part of deposit?
23:15 < swiss> i dunno
23:15 < zero-one> swiss: at this point, paying the first month's rent plus deposit would put me at like... less than $100
23:15 < swiss> you're talking about his 3 month deposit?
23:16 < zero-one> no
23:16 < swiss> what deposit are you talking about then?
23:16 < zero-one> i was talking about the deposit before he upped it
23:17 < swiss> what was it before?
23:17 < zero-one> same as rent
23:17 < swiss> hmmm
23:17 < zero-one> so the first month we'd have been paying double the rent
23:17 < swiss> I can see if I can get my dad to cosign with us, but i dunno
23:17 < zero-one> but now it's triple
23:18 < zero-one> er... actually quadruple since
23:18 < prometheusx> wait, it's 800 a month for 5 of you?
23:18 < swiss> and, frankly, i'd prefer not have my dad cosign with us as he can get controlling
23:18 < prometheusx> 800 per person
23:18 < zero-one> prometheusx: around 460 per person
23:19 < swiss> lol, this middle schooler wants to bang me (Visual Novel)
23:19 < zero-one> hotdogs: ^
23:20 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/OzQvk.jpg aww yeah
23:20 < zero-one> swiss: unless i can talk him down, getting someone to cosign is the only way this is gonna work
23:21 < swiss> yeah. I'd just prefer it wasn't my dad. He's already gonna be controlling as fuck for me due to the fact he's gonna be paying for my rent there, i don't want him having more leverage over the entire house
23:21 < prometheusx> did you just screen shot a screen shot?
23:21 < zero-one> so now we've got two things in our way
23:22 < zero-one> swiss: the first word of the name of that game has "wank" in it
23:22 < swiss> zero-one: wanko means "dog" in japanese
23:23 < swiss> prometheusx: no, window over the screen shot
23:23 < hotdogs> zero-one: is that the sex crime
23:24 < swiss> zero-one: ask if we can pay a slightly higher rent rate for a set amount of time instead
23:24 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah, lolol
23:24 < swiss> maybe another $200 a month
23:24 < swiss> until we build up that deposit
23:30 < zero-one> swiss: i have a feeling that if you wrote this email it might be a little better
23:31 < zero-one> do me a favor and write something, and then send it to me first
23:32 < swiss> kk
23:32 < swiss> startin up dat notepad
23:33 < zero-one> i just imagined you pulling a rip-cord to start notepad
23:33 < zero-one> lol
23:36 < hotdogs> ATTENTION FINE SIRS
23:37 < swiss> zero-one: what's the total amount for each deposit he's asking?
23:37 < swiss> i'm writing up a nice email
23:39 < swiss> I need this to know how much to offer to pay each month, and for how long
23:39 < zero-one> http://pastebin.com/ewNN3b9b
23:40 < hotdogs> lol
23:40 < swiss> what's the exact cost of each month's deposit
23:42 < zero-one> rent is listed as $2300
23:42 < zero-one> per month
23:42 < hotdogs> he wants a single security deposit of 3 * 1 month's rent
23:42 < hotdogs> that's fucking absurd
23:43 < zero-one> hotdogs: agreed, but if i strike a nerve, or make the wrong offer, he might just turn me down altogether
23:43 < hotdogs> I think he's trying to scare you away anyway
23:43 < hotdogs> probably afraid you're gonna make a meth lab, or start squatting and not paying rent after the first month
23:44 < swiss> http://pastebin.com/NmYw08cu
23:44 < swiss> 20 months is a long time though, we might want to talk him down on the total deposit amount
23:44 < hotdogs> lol 20 months
23:45 < swiss> hotdogs: well, he's being unreasonable
23:45 < swiss> and i don't think we can really afford to pay more than $230 extra a month
23:45 < hotdogs> he expects you guys to crumble and not be able to pay past the first month
23:46 < hotdogs> and evicting tenants is a pain in the dick
23:46 < swiss> yeah, well, if we offer to pay more in addition to the deposit
23:46 < swiss> the biggest pita will be renegotiating after a year
23:47 < swiss> asking for the extra deposit to be taken off after we've been faithful
23:47 < hotdogs> that's not what a deposit is for
23:48 < hotdogs> I mean, it is for the fact that you appear potentially unreliable
23:48 < swiss> hotdogs: I'm saying the stuff we haven't paid yeat
23:48 < hotdogs> but that's why he would need it up front
23:48 < hotdogs> to allay the risk of renting to you
23:48 < swiss> well, if we're paying more per month then he gets that much more as a "if we do ditch, you made more money"
23:48 < hotdogs> if you don't pay up front, you invalidate the meaning of the deposit
23:49 < swiss> also, he doesn't seem too smart
23:49 < hotdogs> lol
23:49 < swiss> "there are many David in my address book. "
23:49 < hotdogs> not renting to college students is a smart move, actually
23:49 < swiss> yeah, but 3 months is ridiculous
23:50 < swiss> LOL
23:50 < swiss> I might have to "relieve" my dog-girl when she goes into head
23:50 < hotdogs> it's high because college students are unreliable
23:51 < swiss> yeah, but that's ridiculous on a house that expensive
23:51 < swiss> if he doubled the deposit that'd be understandable
23:52 < hotdogs> why would someone with an expensive home ask for cheaper deposits?
23:52 < swiss> three times though?
23:52 < swiss> "You're college students, I don't think you have money, so I'm gonna try and charge you a LOT more"
23:53 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/0fjfp.jpg hahaha
23:53 < hotdogs> that's why I think he's trying to scare you guys away
23:53 < hotdogs> he could just be throwing out a big number
23:53 < hotdogs> or he could actually expect that it will take him 3 months to get you fuckers out after you stop paying
23:54 < hotdogs> or that you'll do 3x the damage of a normal resident
23:55 < zero-one> swiss: at this point i'm almost thinking it'd be easier to just rent a fucking apartment at the crest
23:55 < swiss> zero-one: it's tempting
23:55 < swiss> but I'd like a house
23:55 < zero-one> me too
23:55 < zero-one> but this fucker is difficult
23:55 < swiss> lets try a bit more
23:56 < zero-one> i'm gonna send you it back with my changes
23:56 < hotdogs> try putting it in his butt
23:56 < swiss> what apartment would we get?
23:56 < zero-one> *send it back to you
23:56 < zero-one> swiss: you know, probably something like that one we looked at
23:56 < zero-one> er..
23:56 < zero-one> actually
23:56 < zero-one> if we got a 2 bedroom
23:56 < swiss> kk. What would we be doing with everyone else?
23:57 < zero-one> we could get a 2 bedroom and just have 2 to a room
23:57 < zero-one> i didn't want to do that  but w/e
23:57 < hotdogs> WELCOME TO THE DORMS
23:57 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah, exactly -_-
23:57 < hotdogs> was that the only house
23:58 < swiss> ffff... I really don't want to ask my dad to cosign
23:58 < swiss> but we might have to
23:58 < swiss> or I might ask my mom.... but we'd need to KNOW we could pay if I ask her
23:58 < zero-one> http://pastebin.com/4xLzPqcs
23:58 < zero-one> hotdogs: basically
23:59 < hotdogs> it's too bad none of the houses in the slummy area along valley are available
--- Day changed Tue Jul 03 2012
00:00 < swiss> zero-one: looks good
00:00 < zero-one> swiss: there's just one problem
00:00 < zero-one> er..
00:00 < zero-one> actually
00:00 < zero-one> let me make one change first
00:01 < swiss> kk
00:01 < alexjandro> How long are you guys gonna live there?
00:02 < swiss> alexjandro: possibly a few years
00:02 < zero-one> alexjandro: at least 2 years
00:03 < prometheusx> zero-one: how much is the deposit now
00:03 < prometheusx> ?
00:03 < swiss> guy wants $6900 in deposit
00:04 < zero-one> which is fucking stupid
00:04 < prometheusx> wasn't it 800 per person before?
00:04 < hotdogs> s/years/hours/
00:05 < zero-one> hotdogs: why do you doubt
00:05 < hotdogs> prometheusx: 2300 rent, 1x rent before
00:05 < hotdogs> now it's 3x
00:05 < zero-one> why are you always on the shitty looking side of the fence
00:05 < zero-one> hotdogs: fix your fucking attitude
00:05 < swiss> zero-one: cause he lives the pine club
00:05 < swiss> shitty side of the fence surrounds that :P
00:06 < swiss> not gonna live in a nice house with the rest of swifthausers
00:06 < hotdogs> swiss: and neither are you
00:06 < swiss> QQ
00:06 < swiss> hotdogs: why you so harsh!
00:06 < hotdogs> lol
00:07 < alexjandro> http://i.imgur.com/Uin2y.png
00:07 < zero-one> swiss: http://pastebin.com/kgJM2JvB
00:07 < swiss> dammit, some people are talking about warhammer in another channel
00:07 < swiss> hilighting the shit out of me
00:07 < zero-one> swiss: only bit i changed was about cosigning
00:07 < hotdogs> zero-one: I did that s/ because that's how I read it as first
00:07 < hotdogs> and it made me laugh
00:07 < swiss> zero-one: ok
00:08 < swiss> sounds good
00:08 < hotdogs> zero-one: but really, did you look at homes for rent in the area along valley by me?
00:08 < prometheusx> zero-one: if you live by hotdogs you can drop by whenever you want!
00:08 < hotdogs> if you want more than 3 bed I guess you're stuck
00:09 < prometheusx> hotdogs: they have about 5 people
00:09 < swiss> zero-one: the seedy valley houses might be perfect
00:09 < hotdogs> lol this one is 882 sq ft, 3 beds
00:09 < hotdogs> jesus
00:09 < hotdogs> swiss: the strange part is that they surround an elementary school
00:10 < zero-one> swiss: i'm not living on valley
00:10 < swiss> PERFECT
00:10 < swiss> zero-one: but but
00:10 < zero-one> no
00:10 < swiss> elementary schoolers!
00:10 < zero-one> fucking no
00:10 < hotdogs> this area isn't really that bad, just slightly lower income and less whitewashed than towards the part of pomona that refuses to call itself pomona
00:10 < prometheusx> zero-one: address of the house?
00:10 < swiss> zero-one: it'd be a better chance for a house
00:10 < zero-one> swiss: this is true
00:10 < zero-one> IDK
00:11 < zero-one> ARGH WHY DOES THIS HAVE TO BE SO DIFFICULT
00:11 < swiss> zero-one: we'll just put a sign out front "This house contains X number of firearms."
00:11 < hotdogs> also, what about along mission
00:11 < zero-one> swiss: people break into houses with the intent of stealing firearms all the time
00:11 < hotdogs> they're mostly 3 bed/1 bath though
00:12 < swiss> hmmmm
00:12 < zero-one> letting people that you don't trust know that you have guns is BAD
00:12 < swiss> zero-one: this house contains burly men with large fists
00:12 < zero-one> swiss: i like that one better
00:12 < swiss> plus, i can set up a good alarm system
00:12 < zero-one> *burlyburly*
00:12 < zero-one> i can rig my shotgun to the door
00:12 < zero-one> lol
00:12 < prometheusx> hotdogs: 3 bed 1 bath sounds terrible
00:13 < zero-one> that's the only alarm we need
00:13 < hotdogs> prometheusx: sounds mexican
00:13 < prometheusx> zero-one: that's illegal
00:13 < swiss> prometheusx: but nobody will live to tell on us
00:15 < hotdogs> alternatively, sell all of your valuables
00:15 < hotdogs> bam, can't get robbed AND you can make rent
00:17 < hotdogs> prometheusx: there's a 4 bed 2 bath, is that good enough
00:17 < prometheusx> hotdogs: why you asking me?
00:17 < hotdogs> prometheusx: does it sound less terrible enough to not be terrible
00:18 < swiss> well, if saree is unsure (aka, out) that sounds good for us
00:23 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/ZqC6Z.jpg LOLOL
00:23 < prometheusx> ...
00:23 < hotdogs> indeed
00:23 < swiss> it got better
00:23 < swiss> one sec
00:24 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/MRxkS.png
00:26 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/m3ccY.jpg Best line ever
00:30 < zero-one> i'm gonna go take a walk
00:30 < zero-one> i need some air
00:30  * zero-one &
00:30 < swiss> i can send you this VN if you need a break ;)
00:32 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/OhjJa.png lollin
01:07 < zero-one> back from my walk
01:07 < zero-one> that was nice
01:08 < prometheusx> masturbating in public must be exciting!
01:11 < zero-one> prometheusx: oh yeah, i real hoot
01:11 < zero-one> *a real hoot
01:12 < zero-one> swiss: we should check out that house on Barjud i guess
01:12 < zero-one> just in case
01:12 < zero-one> it's on valley though
01:12 < zero-one> fuuuuuuuu
01:12 < prometheusx> zero-one: what's the address of the current one you're looking at?
01:17 < zero-one> swiss: help him ot
01:17 < zero-one> *out
01:18 < zero-one> prometheusx: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/Twin-Canyon-Ln-Diamond-Bar-CA-91765/2118783972_zpid/
01:18 < zero-one> swiss: nvm
01:19 < prometheusx> oh, that ones pretty nice
01:19 < zero-one> prometheusx: there is so much room
01:19 < prometheusx> did you ever check out those other house you search for earlier?
01:19 < zero-one> prometheusx: one of them is being leased already
01:20 < zero-one> one is too expensive
01:20 < zero-one> and the last one is on valley and isn't as spacious
01:21 < prometheusx> oh, it's not far from where you are
01:21 < zero-one> prometheusx: yes
01:21 < zero-one> i swear it's like.. perfect
01:22 < zero-one> good distance, good size, and for the most part, good price
01:22 < prometheusx> punch the dude in the balls!
01:22 < zero-one> prometheusx: and then go to jail, and live there
01:23 < prometheusx> free room, and 3 squares a day
01:23 < zero-one> prometheusx: don't forget the ass-rape
01:25 < swiss> zero-one: wait, there's free ass-rape in jail?
01:25 < swiss> Why are we told to avoid it then?
01:25 < zero-one> ...
01:25 < zero-one> no comment
10:04 < timmah> mac n cheese for break-lunch
10:04 < timmah> aww yeah
10:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: timmah: guess what i'm doing
10:30 < timmah> not fapping?
10:30 < timmah> working?
10:30 < timmah> hotdogs is oot and aboot
10:34 < hotdogs> lies and slander
10:46 < timmah> I SAW YOU
10:46 < hotdogs> where
10:46 < hotdogs> WHERE
10:46 < timmah> in your red shirt
10:46 < timmah> OUTSIDE
10:46 < timmah> smoke-break meeting
10:46 < hotdogs> what color were my socks
10:46 < timmah> you were wearing jeans
10:46 < hotdogs> ANSWER THE QUESTION
10:46 < timmah> and my telescope is still pointed at someone's window
10:47 < hotdogs> then you didn't see me at all
10:47 < timmah> I did.
10:47 < timmah> last night.
10:47 < hotdogs> oh really
10:47 < hotdogs> did I come over
10:48 < hotdogs> zero-one: what are you doing
10:48 < timmah> awk {'print $1 $2 $3'}
10:49 < hotdogs> bad quoting
10:49 < timmah> argh singlequotes
10:49 < hotdogs> you're quoting the argument to awk
10:49 < timmah> also I haven't done awk in a while
10:49 < hotdogs> that's not an awk thing, that's a shell thing
10:49 < timmah> it should be {print "$1 $2 $3"}?
10:50 < hotdogs> no
10:50 < hotdogs> awk takes a program as an argument
10:50 < hotdogs> this is a valid program: { print $1 $2 $3 }
10:50 < hotdogs> but if you left it to the shell, you'd pass awk multiple args and your $1 $2 $3 would disappear
10:50 < hotdogs> so you single quote it
10:51 < hotdogs> to tell the shell to fuck off and make it one string without interpolation
10:51 < timmah> gotcha
10:52 < hotdogs> so why did you see me
10:52 < hotdogs> what were you walkin around for
10:53 < timmah> I went up to the 3rd floor
10:53 < timmah> or 4th

15:05 < swiss> asks if I want to delete the lower res one while displaying both to verify the images are the same
15:06 < swiss> and I want another that I can put images into and it will use google image search by image to find higher res versions of that same photo, and ask me if I want to download them
15:06 < zero-one> swiss: i'm fairly sure something like that already exists, and if it doesn't, i don't think i can write it currently
15:07 < swiss> I couldn't easily find one
15:07 < zero-one> brb, laundry
15:08 < swiss> well, i might be able to do doubles with Visipics on windows
15:09 < zero-one> but if you wanted all of that functionality on one application, i'd either need to code it all from scratch, or i'd need API's or libraries that someone else gives me
15:11 < prometheusx> there might be apis for the google image search
15:11 < swiss> It's the second that I'd like right now
15:11 < prometheusx> aspect of the program
15:11 < swiss> and yeah, google image search API is what I'd think you'd use for the second
15:13 < sunrisewolf> gradius: yeah
15:13 < sunrisewolf> gradius: I have an account, you don't need a japanese social security to sign up
15:13 < sunrisewolf> gradius: but it's taking a long time to patch...
15:15 < sunrisewolf> sup gais.
15:16 < swiss> not much
15:16 < swiss> deleting my dupes in my backgrounds direcotries
15:17 < sunrisewolf> why do you have duplicates?
15:17 < swiss> because I grab lots of images from different people that post them
15:17 < swiss> and occasionally i grab 2 of the same, but different resolutions
15:18 < swiss> because I don't notice that I already have the first background
15:18 < sunrisewolf> ahh makes sense! sometimes I download different resolutions as well
15:19 < swiss> VisiPics for windows did a pretty good job for me
15:19 < swiss> zero-one: https://developers.google.com/image-search/
15:32 < swiss> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZYIy2szkIY lollin
15:50 < zero-one> swiss: i got to 0:36 before i had to close it

16:56 < hotdogs> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JdEbokTHdw
16:56 < hotdogs> something like what
16:59 < zero-one> i'm not sure
16:59 < zero-one> maybe timmah would be up for a movie night
16:59 < hotdogs> he is in san diego
16:59 < zero-one> oh
16:59 < hotdogs> also we have work tomorrow at 7 am
16:59 < zero-one> right

16:59 < hotdogs> so *-night is not really an option
17:00 < hotdogs> FRIDAY HOWEVER
17:00 < hotdogs> fuckin movies
17:02 < zero-one> lol
17:02 < hotdogs> unless there's something else happening on friday, in which case oh well

17:16 < zero-one> hotdogs: hookers and blow
17:19 < hotdogs> I'll get right on that
17:26 < airen> Friday?
17:26 < airen> What's up on Friday night?
17:26 < hotdogs> gay sex party
17:37 < swiss> zero-one: create your own deckbox: http://www.cpforbes.net/tuckbox/tuckbox.cgi
17:44 < zero-one> lol
17:44 < zero-one> nah, i already have a designated pocket in my bag
17:49 < swiss> zero-one: It'll protect the cards better
17:49 < swiss> and nice thing is, it's made out of paper (cardstock) so you can custom size it
17:49 < swiss> mine's 2.75"x3.75"x2" to fit them all w/ card covers
17:50 < swiss> and now I'm gonna open it with gimp and try and make cool designs
18:38 < swiss> zero-one: me making a deck box, testing in b&W http://imgur.com/a/Sojwn
18:38 < swiss> first attempt w/ graphics
19:53 < zero-one> swiss: looks like swifthouse is going to have to wait another year
19:54 < zero-one> in the meantime, let's work on either getting an apartment, or getting you in here with me
19:54 < hotdogs> put on a shirt, hobo
19:59 < zero-one> hotdogs: spinning knigits?
19:59 < hotdogs> okay
20:00 < zero-one> i'll be on MY server
20:00 < zero-one> that way it's not COMPLETELY useless
20:01 < hotdogs> uh huh
20:02 < swiss> zero-one: yeah
20:03 < swiss> what's it like at your place?
20:03 < swiss> privacy wise, bandwith, noise expectations?
20:03 < zero-one> swiss: you're basically free to do w/e the fuck you want
20:03 < swiss> also, they don't want firearms, but i might be able to talk them into letting me bring mine as I shoot competitions with it
20:03 < zero-one> swiss: lol no
20:04 < zero-one> you won't be able to convince them
20:04 < zero-one> trust me
20:04 < zero-one> also, don't bring it up at all
20:04 < zero-one> haha
20:04 < swiss> well, i'll ask nicely
20:04 < swiss> if they say no, they say no. But I really should and my family really would like me to
20:05 < zero-one> i guess you can try
20:05 < zero-one> i doubt they'll let you
20:06 < swiss> zero-one: like my new case? http://imgur.com/a/cIfYL i need to print it on heavier cardstock at some point
20:07 < alexjandro> swiss: tits
20:07 < alexjandro> or gtfo
20:07 < swiss> alexjandro: you know I'm a tease
20:09 < alexjandro> GIVE IT UP ALREADY
20:18 < zero-one> swiss: so would you rather move in here, or to an apartment?
21:15 < zero-one> fireworks, check
21:16 < zero-one> jack and coke, check
21:16 < zero-one> claire de lune, check
21:16 < zero-one> cool air, check
21:20 < swiss> zero-one: hmmm, there is sounding pretty nice
21:20 < swiss> but an apartment would aslo be nice
21:20 < zero-one> swiss: it's cheaper if you live here
21:20 < swiss> but, they live in a safer neighborhood, i could park my car on the street safely
21:20 < swiss> what's their interent speed like?
21:21 < zero-one> i had a cable jack put into my room
21:21 < zero-one> it's MY internet speed
21:21 < zero-one> we have seperate lines
21:21 < zero-one> they have dsl
21:21 < swiss> ah
21:21 < swiss> hmm, that's tempting. How much do you pay for internet each month?
21:21 < zero-one> i was getting 20Mbps, but they dropped it to 10
21:21 < zero-one> i pay a flat $30
21:21 < swiss> also, what's the address? checking fios ability
21:23 < swiss> hmmm fios is still $70. 30 sounds better
21:23 < swiss> what cable company do you do it with?
21:24 < zero-one> time warner
21:24 < zero-one> they're the only other provider around here
21:24 < swiss> what's the address? i want to check the costs
21:24 < zero-one> swiss: 24335 Sylvan Glen Rd
21:24 < zero-one> Diamond Bar
21:25 < zero-one> it's more cost effective to run cable
21:25 < zero-one> trust me, i checked
21:25 < swiss> :O turbo means up to 20mbps, but then it's $20 more
21:26 < swiss> I'm tempted to split internet with you and up it to Extreme, then we'd do QoS on the router to make sure we both got 15
21:26 < swiss> if i move in there
21:26 < zero-one> swiss: i'm down for it
21:27 < swiss> it'd be easier too
21:27 < zero-one> the only challenge is finding a way to run cable over to your room
21:27 < zero-one> it's down the hall
21:27 < zero-one> unless you're ok with wireless only
21:27 < swiss> by cable I assume you mean CAT6
21:27 < zero-one> yeah
21:28 < swiss> and the answer lies in the giant box of cat6 housing cable in my dad's office
21:28 < swiss> well, maybe
21:28 < zero-one> haha
21:28 < swiss> do you have another floor above you?
21:28 < swiss> or an attic?
21:28 < zero-one> yeah, we could run it through the attic
21:28 < swiss> shouldn't be hard
21:29 < swiss> hmm...
21:29 < swiss> do you do your laundry at a laundromat, or do you get to use a washer/drier there?
21:29 < zero-one> i use the washer/dryer here
21:29 < zero-one> i'm telling you, these people are super nice
21:29 < zero-one> the house is basically yours
21:29 < swiss> yeah
21:30 < swiss> What do they do with electicity for billing?
21:30 < swiss> I don't plan on being excessive with energy, just wondering if it's just part of a flat rate
21:30 < zero-one> they don't charge me for electricity
21:30 < zero-one> or water
21:30 < zero-one> or gas
21:30 < swiss> zero-one: I think I'm gonna check out your room/house this saturday
21:30 < swiss> when I'm up there
21:31 < zero-one> alright
21:31 < zero-one> sounds good to me
21:31 < swiss> this sounds pretty awesome to me
21:31 < swiss> and we're gonna need to run that CAT6 so that we're linked well :P
21:31 < zero-one> yup
21:32 < swiss> brb, i think I'm gonna go talk to my dad about it now
21:32 < hotdogs> sounds kinda homo
21:36 < swiss> he's for it, so i'd have money to do it
21:36 < swiss> that's prob what's gonna happen in this case
21:36 < swiss> I feel bad for chrislz and jtbot, don't know what their living plans are
21:37 < zero-one> they're good where they are
21:37 < zero-one> jt lives at home
21:37 < zero-one> and chrislz has his own apartment
21:38 < swiss> yeah. I hope chrislz still has that apartment
21:38 < swiss> lol :P
21:39 < alexjandro> you should let them know
21:39 < zero-one> alexjandro: that's the plan
21:39 < zero-one> as soon as chrislz wakes up
21:40 < alexjandro> swiss: so you are gonna come this Sat
21:41 < swiss> alexjandro: that's my plan
21:43 < alexjandro> yay I can show you my ricer-mobile!
21:43 < zero-one> alexjandro: what did you add to it?
21:44 < zero-one> it looks EXACTLY THE SAME
21:44 < alexjandro> nah its a bit lower
21:44 < alexjandro> and stiffer ;)
21:47 < alexjandro> zero-one: you cant fit your hands in the wheel wells anymore
21:47 < zero-one> wat
21:47 < zero-one> oh damn

12:14 < swiss> if I may ask, why?
12:15 < zero-one> trying to buy stuff with your credit card online
12:15 < swiss> lol, don't worry
12:15 < zero-one> also, trying to send you email
12:15 < swiss> it only has ~ $1.64 on it
12:16 < swiss> http://speedcap.net/img/f7e050c7d614ef0dcafff48deecb214c/65326037.png This has to be real, rihgt?

12:17 < swiss> that was in my spam folder
12:17 < zero-one> you need to clean up your shit bro
12:17 < swiss> I was going through spam because i was wondering if you already sent it
12:18 < swiss> if that isn't what you meant (making it spam) please explain more
12:18 < zero-one> swiss: i didn't send that
12:18 < zero-one> lol

13:13 < hotdogs> Hi!
13:13 < timmah> hotdogs: remembered!
13:13 < hotdogs> what did you remember
13:16 < timmah> aaannndddd tim's out of the office
13:16 < hotdogs> aww yeah
13:16 < hotdogs> something for monday
13:16 < timmah> cool, I can't do shit!
13:16 < hotdogs> we already knew that
13:16 < timmah> I guess I could send more e-mails or log the dcmas
13:17 < timmah> or figure out apcupsd
13:18 < hotdogs> I can't think of a good command name for my keepass cli thing
13:18 < hotdogs> a bunch of kp* stuff is used for kpathsea things
13:18 < timmah> clitpass
13:19 < hotdogs> I guess I could use kpass-*, but it sounds like kpasswd
13:19 < hotdogs> I think I'll just do that anyway
13:19 < timmah> pick something that can automatically auto-complete
13:19 < timmah> start it with x
13:19 < timmah> or q
13:20 < alexjandro> hotdogs: just use passwd
13:21 < alexjandro> timmah: http://www.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/vctop/d03/vc5004.htm
13:22 < alexjandro> timmah: " principally for purposes of exhibition and historic vehicle club activities." nah
13:22 < timmah> ahhh
13:22 < timmah> oh wait
13:22 < timmah> there is a spitfire club
13:22 < alexjandro> im sure there is
13:28 < timmah> vgy
13:28 < alexjandro> what
13:29 < timmah> yes
13:29 < timmah> I know there is one
13:29 < alexjandro> timmah: here is the course http://www.adamsmotorsportspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/AMP-track.pnghttp://www.adamsmotorsportspark.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/AMP-track.png

14:11 < swiss> zero-one: the MC is a bitch beta (imagine early Simon) but the show is awesome
14:17 < hotdogs> alexjandro: just had to let it warm up
15:25 < timmah> hng
15:25 < timmah> looks like I get to learn apache
15:26 < swiss> timmah: sounds fun
15:26 < swiss> optimize mine after you learn~
15:26 < timmah> swiss: if I even get that far
15:27 < airen> swiss: I can do that.
15:27 < airen> swiss: and/or show you how.
15:27 < swiss> airen: You know, i don't know why I didn't ask. If you don't have anyhting secretive in there, can you post/send me your apache conf files
15:28 < airen> swiss: I'll send you sanitized versions of them.
15:28 < swiss> I should optimize it so I can run wordpress and another plain html site as vhots
15:28 < swiss> hosts*
15:28 < swiss> dunno if I can do it on 256MB
15:30 < hotdogs> set maxclients to 1
15:30 < hotdogs> problem solved
15:30 < swiss> hotdogs: lol
15:31 < airen> swiss: It's rather simple.
15:31 < hotdogs> why you laugh
15:31 < airen> swiss: You can optomize mysql as well.
15:31 < swiss> hotdogs: it would kinda defeat the purpose
15:31 < hotdogs> why
15:31 < airen> s/om/im/
15:31 < hotdogs> what purpose? serving a website on low ram? that's precisely what you do
15:31 < swiss> airen: yeah, i need to do that to run wordpress, don't I
15:33 < hotdogs> if you're using worker processes and you leave maxclients too high, your shit is going to blow up
15:33 < airen> swiss: You *can* run wordpress with sqlite iirc, but it's a hack. Same thing goes with nginx.
15:47 < gradius> yeah, you can run it on both. but config'ing it's a bit different.
15:47 < gradius> I personally haven't tried it.
15:48 < hotdogs> run it with two front ends and two back ends for maximum redundancy
15:51 < gradius> Ill run into your two backends.
15:52 < hotdogs> Okay

13:01 < hotdogs> also, I think there are more recent revisions of that book
13:02 < hotdogs> but if you think OS concepts are some bleeding edge thing, you're mistaken
13:04 < hotdogs> they don't have a manga guide to OS concepts
13:05 < hotdogs> also, I never actually read the dinosaur book
13:05 < hotdogs> I never read any textbook, for the most part
13:05 < hotdogs> too fuckin' wordy

20:17 < swiss> 1st gen driod
20:21 < drboots> swiss: Finally joining the present, are we?
20:21 < prometheusx> ah, world droid i guess? or a sholes one
20:22 < swiss> drboots: i hate the tiny keyboard
20:22 < swiss> i don't like touch screen
20:22 < swiss> but he won't let me bring my laptop
20:23 < prometheusx> why not?
20:23 < swiss> "pack light"
20:23 < drboots> Prolly because the TSA will rape it, and then the European equivalents will do worse
20:23 < swiss> aka "your laptop is smaller and lighter than mine, and I don't want to see you working on a laptop and not having the joy of doing the same on my own
20:24 < drboots> "Sir, this operating system looks suspicious, I think I will need to take a look to ensure there's no terrorism happening in it"
20:24 < prometheusx> they also image your hdd
20:24 < drboots> The tSA images your hard drive now?
20:24 < swiss> prometheusx: i don't have anythign bad on... oh wait
20:25 < swiss> maybe i should remove some doujins first......
20:25 < drboots> or are those the Europeans?  Because this is the first I have heard of that
20:25 < prometheusx> drboots: yeah, they've been doing it for years now
20:25 < alexjandro> swiss: protip, don't travel with 2 laptops
20:26 < swiss> prometheusx: do they image *everyone's* hard drive?
20:26 < alexjandro> no
20:26 < swiss> or just occasional
20:26 < prometheusx> swiss: yeah, if you have loli stuff you can get hit with cp charges
20:26 < swiss> prometheusx: I guess i won't put those doujins on the droid
20:26 < swiss> which reminds me...
20:26 < prometheusx> they don't care about phones
20:26 < alexjandro> They didn't even think twice about my laptop when I went to nationals
20:27 < prometheusx> zero-one got his laptop taken to some back room going to nationals
20:27 < swiss> LOL
20:27 < drboots> That's ludicrous

20:29 < zero-one> "said the man who said he works as an engineer in the computer industry"
20:29 < zero-one> the fuck is this shit
20:31 < prometheusx> the shit is this fuck
20:40 < drboots> prometheusx: Are you sure they imaged zero-one's laptop as opposed to just checking it?  Only CBP agents are really allowed warrantless hard drive imaging
20:42 < prometheusx> no clue really, he just told me they took it off in to a backroom
20:43 < drboots> The TSA is really only allowed to check for explosives.  the only time you have to worry about CBP is when you're coming into the country.  At the same time, swiss would have to deal with the European equivalent
20:44 < zero-one> drboots: i saw them haul off my backpack
20:44 < zero-one> lost track of them
20:44 < zero-one> they brought it back with all of the zippers undone
20:44 < zero-one> all because "i left my computer in the bag"
20:44 < zero-one> when chrislz, who went right fucking before me did the same thing
20:44 < zero-one> and didn't get hassled
20:45 < drboots> you have to remember:  You're also "suspicious" and the TSA agents possess little in the way of education
20:46 < zero-one> THE FUCK IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
20:46 < zero-one> I'M SUSPICIOUS

00:07 < zero-one> hahaha
09:44 < timmah> ಠ_ಠ
09:44 < timmah> does that look alright?
09:44 < timmah> I can't tell
09:45 < timmah> fuckin gnome
09:49 < hotdogs> you need to install fonts bro
09:50 < timmah> hng
09:50 < timmah> okay
09:50 < timmah> I was hoping being utf-8 would be enough
09:51 < hotdogs> riiiight
09:51 < hotdogs> there are lots of unicode characters that you don't have glyphs for, though
09:51 < hotdogs> I think you want lohit-fonts
09:51 < hotdogs> not sure what it is in debian
09:52 < timmah> hmm
09:53 < timmah> I see xfonts
09:53 < timmah> some ttf
09:54 < hotdogs> ttf-indic-fonts
09:54 < timmah> indian language?
09:55 < hotdogs> ttf-malayalam-fonts?
09:55 < timmah> why not ttf-oriya-fonts
09:55 < hotdogs> whats oriya
09:55 < timmah> for the Oriya language, duh
09:55 < hotdogs> install one, test, uninstall
09:57 < timmah> xfonts-efont-unicode*
09:57 < timmah> so sayeth the interwebs
09:57 < zero-one> get the armenian fonts
10:04 < timmah> nah

10:55 < gradius> DEATH MOOSE RETURNS
10:56 < zero-one> this kills the moose
10:56 < gradius> lolololol
10:56  * zero-one gets the sandpaper
10:56 < hotdogs> gradius: how's work
10:56 < hotdogs> who do I have to sleep with to get singed's poison changed back to purple
10:56 < gradius> idk what'd it change to?
10:57 < hotdogs> green
10:57 < hotdogs> alternatively, make them change the color of surfer singed's poison
10:57 < hotdogs> that would be acceptable
10:58 < hotdogs> the effect changed as well
10:58 < hotdogs> it's a lot more murky now
10:58 < hotdogs> which makes the choice of green odd, because it blends in with the terrain
10:58 < hotdogs> and I can only assume it's horrible for color blind people, but it's still green in color blind mode
11:02 < gradius> yah :(
11:02 < hotdogs> so, you know, spin it like that
11:03 < hotdogs> I'm sad that my poison isn't purple though because I'm afraid I'll get kicked off of purpleteam
11:13 < gradius> aww :(
11:13 < zero-one> gradius: since you arrived at riot, things have gone to shit
11:13 < zero-one> i'm asking you to resign
11:13 < zero-one> for us all
11:13 < gradius> you know.
11:13 < gradius> That would make sense.
11:13 < gradius> Butt fuck it.
11:14 < zero-one> lolol
11:14 < gradius> I like it here.
11:14 < hotdogs> zero-one: there's an easier solution
11:14 < hotdogs> stop playing LoL
11:14 < zero-one> hotdogs: OR WE CAN RESORT TO MURDER
11:14 < zero-one> MWAHAHAHAHA
11:14 < hotdogs> speaking of stopping playing LoL, gradius: are you going to be playing games while traffic dies down this evening
11:21 < gradius> hotdogs: sounds good to me :D
11:21 < gradius> lets plan for around 7ish?
11:22 < hotdogs> alrightr
11:23 < hotdogs> make sure you reboot beforehand
11:23 < hotdogs> so you will be able to get in game
11:28 < gradius> yeah wtf was that
11:28 < gradius> it's workign now
11:28 < gradius> but who knows.
11:57 < timmah> zero-one: hotdogs: food?

12:01 < zero-one> gotta finish up something real quick
12:02 < zero-one> come in if you want
12:02 < timmah> I wanted to but there was a line
12:02 < zero-one> timmah: i have a chair waiting for you
12:02 < zero-one> lol
12:02 < timmah> your erection is not a chair
12:04 < hotdogs> why not
12:07 < zero-one> timmah: hotdogs: omw to the pole
12:07 < timmah> zero-one: rgr
12:12 < timmah> hotdogs: shall we dance?
12:16 < hotdogs> oh right
12:16 < hotdogs> uhh meet you down there at some point
15:23 < timmah> I might be able to fully automate the reports
15:23 < timmah> aww yeah
15:24 < hotdogs> OH MAN
15:29 < zero-one> oh man
15:30 < zero-one> aww yeah
15:45 < timmah> so thunderbird saves its mail as flat files
15:47 < timmah> I just can't tell what the update interval is
15:49 < zero-one> timmah: there's a setting in thunderbird that lets you change how often it fetches mail -_-
15:49 < timmah> zero-one: no not that
15:50 < timmah> the flat file says there's mail in it
15:50 < timmah> but there isn't in the mailbox
15:51 < airen> >thunderbird
15:51 < airen> timmah: Switch to claws like snotdogs

15:59 < airen> zero-one: Dunno, I know hawtdawgs likes it over thunderbird.
15:59 < airen> I use mutt.
16:07 < timmah> hotdogs: you were right about the viagra thing
16:07 < timmah> it has to be in the search terms otherwise a 303
16:08 < timmah> and not the 302 redirect
16:08 < timmah> montgomery is still busted
16:09 < hotdogs> lolo
16:26 < timmah> it gets better: as long as the redirect has viagra in it, it don't care
16:26 < timmah> doesn't have to be from a specific website
16:38 < hotdogs> yeah I figured
16:49 < gradius> hotdogs: were you the one that wanted to know your normal elo?
16:49 < gradius> or was it mrblah

16:56 < hotdogs> llololo

16:59 < hotdogs> si
17:00 < zero-one> gradius: spimds beudn to me sir
17:02 < gradius> har har
17:02 < gradius> zero-one: after learning a lot about pci at riot
17:02 < gradius> reasoning behind the credit union not being able to manage their own firewall makes perfect sense.
17:03 < zero-one> huh
17:03 < zero-one> really?
17:03 < zero-one> because i still thnk it's a load of shit
17:04 < hotdogs> read the pci requirements yourself then
17:04 < hotdogs> they're nuts
17:05 < zero-one> i wouldn't doubt it
17:05 < hotdogs> the docs they publish are pretty simple to read
17:07 < gradius> yeah
17:07 < gradius> the big thing is
17:07 < hotdogs> you need formal processes for everything, formal documentation for everything
17:07 < gradius> if your system can access another system that controls PCI compliance (ACLs, rulesets, routing, etc..)
17:07 < gradius> then that system accessing it must also fall under PCI compliance.
17:08 < hotdogs> yep
17:08 < gradius> and fuck if you're ever going to get that from a pc at the CU
17:09 < hotdogs> then again, the campus gets away with not really being pci so who knows
17:11 < hotdogs> Remove all unnecessary
17:11 < hotdogs> functionality, such as scripts, drivers,
17:11 < hotdogs> features, subsystems, file systems, and
17:11 < hotdogs> unnecessary web servers.
17:11 < hotdogs> lolololo
17:11 < gradius> YUP LOLOL
17:11 < gradius> haha
17:13 < hotdogs> they've been battling a long time on campus to reduce what we have that needs to be PCI
17:13 < hotdogs> since there's no separation
17:54 < hotdogs> zero-one: timmah I think that song is on KSPC again
18:36 < hotdogs> I think it's their announcement jingle...
18:40 < timmah> lolwut reeally

14:33 < alexjandro> huh*
14:35 < zero-one> gradius: we're going to have a going away party for you
14:35 < zero-one> and a housewarming party
14:35 < zero-one> and a one week moving anniversary party
14:36 < zero-one> and we'll see what else we can't squeeze in there
14:37 < prometheusx> alexjandro: no ac in your car?
14:41 < alexjandro> nope
14:41 < sunrisewolf> prometheusx: even more of a party without it
14:42 < zero-one> i have a plan guys
14:42 < zero-one> guys
14:42 < zero-one> guys
14:42 < zero-one> seriusly guys
14:42 < zero-one> ok, here's what we're gonna do:
14:43 < zero-one> blow up the sun
14:43 < zero-one> eh?
14:43 < zero-one> eh?
14:43 < zero-one> genius, i know
14:45 < sunrisewolf> we'd either burn or freeze to death, who's interested to find out?
14:45 < zero-one> i am
14:45 < prometheusx> pfft, we'd burn first
14:45 < prometheusx> SCIENCE BITCHES
14:45 < DrItanium> prometheusx: Not necessarily, the shock could just shift our orbit so we may just get crushed by falling debris
14:46 < sunrisewolf> no if the sun blows up on it's own we burn, who knows what would happen if WE blew it up!
14:46 < sunrisewolf> DrItanium: that too.
14:46 < DrItanium> Well we would have an 8 minute buffer before the light of the explosion hits us
14:47 < sunrisewolf> 8 minutes..
14:47 < sunrisewolf> what would you do if you had 8 minutes?
14:47 < prometheusx> what i do every night pinky
14:48 < sunrisewolf> prometheusx: shut up
14:48 < sunrisewolf> lol
14:48 < sunrisewolf> 8 minutes to take over the world
14:48 < sunrisewolf> laaaaame
14:48 < prometheusx> or masturbate furiously
14:48 < sunrisewolf> so you'd own the world for like 30 seconds.
14:48 < sunrisewolf> or have the best orgasm ever/burning in flames/dead
14:49 < prometheusx> pain makes the orgasm better
15:19 < hotdogs> how would you know they're your last 8 minutes
15:36 < zero-one> hotdogs: live every 8 minutes like they're your last and you won't have to worry
15:36 < hotdogs> brb fappin
15:37 < hotdogs> also, even if I knew it was my last 8 minutes I probably wouldn't do anything interesting
15:38 < timmah> hotdogs: I'd probably just lie down and put a bag over my head
15:38 < timmah> It'd make me feel better
15:39 < hotdogs> make faces in the mirror one last night
15:39 < hotdogs> er, time
16:02 < timmah> hotdogs: we were in such a hurry to leave the car I forgot the parking pass
16:03 < hotdogs> oh lol
16:03 < timmah> I got lucky
16:03 < timmah> discovered it when I grabbed my boiling water
16:04 < hotdogs> lol
17:20 < prometheusx> zero-one: your sd card ever come in?
17:21 < zero-one> prometheusx: yup, swapped out the cards on sunday
17:21 < zero-one> prometheusx: i'll get yours back to you when i see you
17:23 < prometheusx> ok, want to backup the stuff i have on it before i wipe it and give it to airen
17:23 < airen> Schweet.

17:38 < timmah> "A real man will rise when a woman enters the room so the lady may have a seat"

10:00 < hotdogs> I maybe almost hit you
10:00 < timmah> hotdogs: HOW COULD YOU MISS
10:01 < zero-one> hotdogs: lolol
10:01 < zero-one> if you did, i didn't notice
10:01 < hotdogs> you didn't really look up
10:01 < hotdogs> so I turned around and did another pass
10:02 < hotdogs> and I even honked and waved
10:02 < timmah> hotdogs: my office mate complimented me on my car
10:02 < timmah> He saw me pass him on temple
10:02 < timmah> It was odd
10:03 < hotdogs> lol
10:03 < timmah> I miss being alone
10:03 < hotdogs> HOW NICE OF HIM
10:03 < hotdogs> WHAT A JERK
10:06 < zero-one> hotdogs: you totally did not honk and turn around
10:06 < hotdogs> are you calling me a liar
10:07 < hotdogs> who would do that
10:07 < hotdogs> who would go on the internet
10:07 < hotdogs> and start telling lies
10:07 < zero-one> hahaha
10:07 < zero-one> a/s/l

10:35 < gradius> we should start playing draft, because blind pick is REALLY fucking me up.
10:36 < gradius> I haven't had a win in at least 10 games.
10:36 < zero-one> gradius: yeah, time for draft pick
10:36 < gradius> And the last blind pick game I played, 3/5 of the people instalocked.
10:36 < gradius> Then proceded to argue over lanes.

10:37 < hotdogs> gradius: turn on your hacks

10:59 < timmah> "OH GOD SOMETHING IS PENETRATING ME"
11:02 < timmah> I'll just stop talking now.
11:03 < zero-one> hotdogs: have you ever heard a set with duplicate values called a "multiset" before?
11:03 < hotdogs> no not really
11:04 < hotdogs> but wikipedia makes it look like a legit term
11:04 < zero-one> yeah...
11:04 < hotdogs> are you reading about databases because that would make sense
11:05 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah
11:06 < zero-one> i'm curious to see how i can call routines that aren't SQL from SQL
11:09 < zero-one> er... by that i mean "external routines"
11:11 < hotdogs> I don't know what you mean
11:11 < zero-one> http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.db2.udb.apdv.sql.doc%2Fdoc%2Fc0020471.htm
11:12 < zero-one> i could set up complex triggers that do all kinds of neat things
11:13 < zero-one> i'm not sure what exactly yet though
11:15 < hotdogs> MORE UNEXPECTED BEHAVIOR, PLEASE!
11:15 < hotdogs> why are you looking at the docs for DB2, lolo
11:16 < hotdogs> I have seen talk of stuff like the main table that holds the keys to all the other tables having something-I-can't-remember-the-name of which, when the main table row gets removed, removes shit from all the other tables
11:16 < hotdogs> consistency and all that
11:17 < hotdogs> instead of doing it in multiple queries and remembering to actually do it
11:19 < zero-one> hotdogs: i only pulled up those docs because they go over external routines
11:19 < zero-one> and you asked
11:25 < hotdogs> oh
11:50 < timmah> zero-one: hotdogs: food?
11:50 < hotdogs> FOOD?
11:50 < timmah> are we slaves to our scheduled meals?
11:51 < hotdogs> Yes.
11:52 < zero-one> hotdogs: timmah: have to help out at the swift table
11:53 < zero-one> BUT I'M SOOO HONGRY
11:53 < hotdogs> after lunch
11:53 < zero-one> hotdogs: one sec, lemme talk to dah baws
11:55 < hotdogs> do I need to write a note
11:59 < zero-one> omw in 5
13:18 < prometheusx> zero-one: swift table? is this for orientation?
14:16 < timmah> prometheusx: probably
14:38 < hotdogs> timmah: so there's a damage chart for dayz...the lee enfield does 12500 blood apparently

14:46 < timmah> I'm disappoint the crossbow doesn't do more
14:55 < hotdogs> yes
14:55 < hotdogs> it really should be one hit
14:55 < hotdogs> on zombies
14:56 < hotdogs> I guess that's a balance request though and he doesn't do that
15:34 < timmah> hotdogs: nap time?
15:34 < hotdogs> uhh
15:34 < hotdogs> are we gonna take a nap together or something?
15:35 < hotdogs> now I'm tired though

15:53 < zero-one> hotdogs: i decided to bike home right after we parted
15:53 < zero-one> bad idea :(
15:54 < hotdogs> are you all sweaty now

15:56 < zero-one> hotdogs: i feel so dirty
15:56 < hotdogs> oh my
15:56 < zero-one> i'm completely soaked right now
15:56 < hotdogs> good exercise as long as you don't die
15:57 < zero-one> MAKE THE SUN GO AWAY
15:57 < zero-one> I'M TIRED OF THIS WEATHER
15:59 < hotdogs> TOO BAD
16:00 < hotdogs> TIME TO GO DOWNSTAIRS
16:01 < prometheusx> zero-one: you're a crazy mofo for doing that
16:03 < zero-one> hotdogs: don't think i need to go downstairs today
16:03 < zero-one> it's cooler than usual in my room
16:03 < zero-one> prometheusx: yeah, i'm pretty insane
16:04 < zero-one> but it was like.. i wanted to be home NOW
16:04 < prometheusx> i'd rather be alive and bored then dead from heat stroke
16:08 < timmah> the urge to fap is strong with this one
16:08 < zero-one> timmah: lolol
16:08 < prometheusx> they have bathrooms at school and he has a smart phone now!
16:49 < gradius> Fuck, with my string of losses, my normal elo has dropped to 1150.
16:49 < gradius> At least I can maybe start stomping people if I soloqueue at that elo.
16:50 < gradius> idk how I keep getting retarded teams.
16:51 < alexjandro> Maybe they match you with like people..
16:51 < gradius> :(
16:51 < gradius> But I'm not THAT bad.
17:17 < hotdogs> gradius: is mine above 1200 still
17:22 < gradius> yeah
17:23 < gradius> I've just had a huge loss streak that's killed me elo
17:23 < gradius> my*
17:24 < hotdogs> ME TOO
17:25 < gradius> we need to start playing 5s
17:25 < gradius> Instead of queing with randoms.
17:26 < hotdogs> I dunno
17:26 < hotdogs> 5v5s tend to go against us anyway
17:26 < gradius> Yah, it's a toss up between getting a bad random
17:26 < gradius> and queuing against good 5s
17:27 < gradius> We can do well if we don't fuck up
17:27 < hotdogs> at least we don't usually bring our own bad 5th now
17:27 < hotdogs> like MinecraftServer or something
17:27 < gradius> yeah
17:27 < timmah> or that vannan guy
17:27 < gradius> haha
17:27 < timmah> what a noob

17:32 < hotdogs> gradius: we need to improve our elos
17:32 < hotdogs> we can't do that if you play eve
17:33 < gradius> haha
17:33 < gradius> EVE is click a skill up and afk
17:33 < gradius> or mine + afk
17:33 < gradius> :)
17:33 < prometheusx> he can play LoL while waiting a month to skill up
17:36 < gradius> prometheusx: truth.
17:37 < gradius> Though, I haven't put that many months into it, so I haven't hit that long of skillup queues.
18:08 < gradius> Would any of you be interested in a game around 7?

23:34 < sunrisewolf> Doesn't matter I guess, so I downloaded this program that runs in the background and I want to daemonize it.
23:34 < sunrisewolf> so I (think) I wrote a config file
23:34 < sunrisewolf> but how do I make rc.d use it?
23:35 < zero-one> sunrisewolf: you mean you wrote an init script?
23:35 < airen> http://weeabros.org:8000/stream.ogg
23:36 < airen> sunrisewolf: I tried it, but it bugged my eyes.
23:39 < sunrisewolf> well I'm not sure I just want it to basically run "redshift -l 34.05:-118.24 -t 6000:4000" when I boot.

23:41 < sunrisewolf> yep I use arch, I'll check it out
23:42 < zero-one> sunrisewolf: open up /etc/rc.local with vim, and just add your line
23:42 < zero-one> does that return immediately?
23:42 < zero-one> or block until it's done?
23:44 < zero-one> airen: fucking lol

21:00 < prometheusx> once they merge some of the things they need to do by hand they're going straight to cm10 so i'd wait
21:00 < prometheusx> but unlock and root
21:02 < timmah> should be unlocked
21:02 < timmah> gotta root it then

17:57 < timmah> airen: dat ender?
17:57 < airen> timmah: They are scary.
17:57 < airen> Man, I looking at /r/minecraft almost makes me want to play...
17:58 < timmah> airen: the new snapshots updates look pretty sweet
18:04 < gradius> What's going on with the new stuff.
18:04 < gradius> I actually just started a multiplayer server for myself w/ computercraft + redstonecraft mod.
18:04 < gradius> Which is why I didnt sleep until 4AM.
18:05 < gradius> Trying to play it legit, but I want to use comptercraft + the redstone mod to create my own internet of sorts.
18:05 < gradius> Computercraft runs on Lua.
18:06 < gradius> rather, the computer you interact with can run lua scripts, and can interact wireless with little robots. and has a GPS implementation, but I'm trying to build legit.
18:07 < gradius> But I think it'd be fun to have an army of little robots mining + an internet I can use to control redstone stuff + monitor things. I WANT A DATACENTER IN MINECRAFT.
18:07 < airen> Single player and multiplayer are the same thing now
18:09 < gradius> Meaning the same codE?
18:09 < gradius> code*
18:09 < gradius> and meaning you can port worlds back and fourth?
18:13 < airen> Meaning you can have people play on your local world.
18:13 < airen> Meaning single player is just a localhost server
18:20 < gradius> Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
18:20 < gradius> interesting.

14:44 < gradius> maybe its not needed

14:45 < prometheusx> gradius: ONE RULES NO KB!
14:45 < DrItanium> prometheusx: WAT?
14:45 < timmah> prometheusx: what about knockouts?
14:46 < DrItanium> So we can ban people as long as they haven't been kicked by the same action...gotcha!
14:46 < prometheusx> pfft, i mean no banning in general, makes zombies ops no fun
14:47 < gradius> DrItanium: hahaha
14:47 < gradius> the big thing is if you ban
14:47 < gradius> and the person is afk
14:47 < DrItanium> So I can kill lord british and make the game unwinnable but killing the bad guy which is logical.....
14:47 < gradius> they dont know why they got banned

15:05 < hotdogs> gradius: where's my ops
15:05 < hotdogs> gradius: do you have this channel registered
15:15 < Kos> http://www.businessinsider.com/bloomberg-apple-must-post-notice-online-in-uk-saying-samsung-didnt-copy-ipad-2012-7
15:15 < Kos> interesting that that is even a legal punishmnet...
15:18 < Kos> totally wrong window
15:19 < Kos> fuck you all for making me think I was in #swift
15:19 < hotdogs> lol
15:19 < hotdogs> yeah I don't really like having multiple swift people channels
15:19 < hotdogs> but that's what has happened
15:19 < Kos> yeah
15:20 < Kos> this is wwhat we used to do in old irc networks/channels I used to hang out with
15:20 < Kos> too many noobs
15:20 < Kos> would start an originals channel
15:20 < hotdogs> I thought about wjoin'ing them in one window but I think that would be a little too nuts
15:20 < Kos> LOL
15:20 < hotdogs> and I'd end up sending messages to the wrong channel
15:20 < hotdogs> it would preserve my alt key though
15:21 < Kos> but do the opposite to your x key
15:22 < hotdogs> yep
15:23 < gradius> hotdogs: yeah I have the channel registered.
15:24 < gradius> and yeah, I've heard of the subswift channels but i dont give enough fucks to try and hunt them out || join them.
15:24 < zero-one> #swift-armed-left is pretty popular
15:25 < gradius> haha
15:25 < DrItanium> gradius: Make girldius do a join scraping to find out all owned permutations of swift...shouldn't take more than a couple months
15:25 < gradius> that's not a bad idea, but meh.

15:25 < zero-one> DrItanium: that sounds like a good idea
15:25 < DrItanium> zero-one: That's a terrible idea

15:25 < hotdogs> why not /list
15:25 < gradius> zero-one: that's a great idea
15:25 < zero-one> you could map out all the channels that people visit
15:26 < zero-one> and stalk them
15:26 < gradius> OH JESUS FUCK

10:21 < alexjandro> hotdogs: i think im gonna pull a kos and bring peanut butter, jelly, and break
10:21 < alexjandro> bread
10:24 < hotdogs> if I use my bread maker I'll have to pre-slice it
10:24 < hotdogs> if I pre-slice it, I might as well make sandwiches right then
10:30 < gradius> and if you make sandwiches then, you may as well eat them
10:31 < gradius> and if you eat them you need to make more break.
10:31 < gradius> dat loop.
10:31 < hotdogs> good point

12:05 < chrislz> is with black licorice
12:05 < swiss> i was served it with water and sugar
12:05 < swiss> zero-one: it isnt
12:05 < chrislz> we got this bag of candy and we were like "AWESOME!"
12:06 < swiss> repealed
12:06 < hotdogs> why is black licorice banned
12:06 < chrislz> but it was all black licorice
12:06 < chrislz> and blck licorice sucks
12:06 < zero-one> hotdogs: no, absinthe
12:06 < swiss> chrislz: i love it
12:06 < hotdogs> black licorice is banned because of absinthe?
12:06 < swiss> zero-one: absinthe is sold in vegas
12:06 < swiss> buy me some as a birthday gift <3
12:07 < swiss> hotdogs: you are now a felon
12:07 < swiss> black licorice eater
12:07 < zero-one> chrislz: let's do it. absinthe in vegas
12:08 < swiss> sailor jerry is cheap on freemont street
12:09 < swiss> i got smashed for $20 on a fifth of jerry and a bottle of coke
12:09 < hotdogs> swiss: I'm not a felon
12:09 < zero-one> hotdogs: not yet you aren't
12:09 < hotdogs> you have to be convicted
12:09 < zero-one> just wait until defcon
12:09 < hotdogs> CAN'T CATCH ME, COPPERS
12:09 < swiss> lol
12:09 < hotdogs> I am the least felonious member of this channel
12:09 < swiss> as we'd say in weeaboo land.....
12:10 < swiss> ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH
12:10 < zero-one> swiss: you think if i bring back a disassembled 30-round mag for my saiga they can bust me for it?
12:10 < swiss> nope
12:10 < hotdogs> what if someone reports him
12:10 < swiss> especially if you put it under the spare in the trunk
12:10 < zero-one> hotdogs: you will be raped and killed
12:11 < hotdogs> you wanna get expelled?
12:11 < swiss> also, not illegal to own in california
12:11 < swiss> only illegal to load more than 10
12:11 < swiss> illegal to sell in california though
12:11 < zero-one> swiss: uh... are you SURE about that
12:11 < zero-one> i think they're illegal to own
12:12 < swiss> well, if so, the swiss gun club is super illegal
12:12 < zero-one> LOL
12:12 < swiss> 4 of our members shoot their sig550s with 30 round mags
12:12 < swiss> at burro canyon
12:13 < swiss> 5 feet from the range master
12:13 < swiss> and police that come to shoot
12:13 < zero-one> and they loaded only 10?
12:13 < swiss> ermmmm
12:13 < zero-one> hotdogs: i wanna take you to the range with me next time i go
12:13 < swiss> when the police were nearby, yes
12:14 < swiss> zero-one: btw, you will be in pain after shooting the k31
12:14 < zero-one> hotdogs: have you ever shot a gun before?
12:14 < swiss> my friend just got back from bootcamp and managed a total of 4 shots before it hurt too bad
12:15 < hotdogs> zero-one: yes, nerf guns, all the time
12:15 < swiss> i'll take you in september probably, and you can laugh when i have to shoot my 18 shot program... i dont like firing more than 10 in a day because of the pain
12:15 < hotdogs> and some cap guns
12:16 < hotdogs> some water guns too
12:16 < hotdogs> I know the drill, point them at other people and shoot
12:16 < zero-one> hotdogs: hahahah. it'll be fun. would you be interested?
12:16 < hotdogs> nope
12:18 < zero-one> awww
12:19 < zero-one> alright :(
12:19 < hotdogs> I don't want to be around firearms and unstable individuals at the same time
12:19 < zero-one> ...
12:19 < prometheusx> hotdogs: laser tag!
12:19 < swiss> hotdogs: i'll let you hold the gun first
12:19 < zero-one> who are you calling unstable
12:19 < hotdogs> referring, of course, to myself
12:19 < hotdogs> prometheusx: bowling!
12:20 < prometheusx> im down for some bowling
12:21 < zero-one> can we shoot the pins?
12:22 < swiss> i'd be down for bowling. i have a club member card at round one, so i think we'd get a discount
12:22 < zero-one> swiss: why round oen?
12:22 < zero-one> *one
12:22 < zero-one> we have a perfectly good bowling alley right here in diamond bar
12:22 < hotdogs> that place is sweet
12:22 < hotdogs> but oak tree lanes is apparently not complete shit nowadays
12:23 < swiss> zero-one: i have the card cause its weeaboo heaven
12:23 < hotdogs> zero-one: because we can do one game of bowling then move on to karaoke
12:23 < swiss> initial d stage 4, taiko, giant osu! like game, japanese style karaoke
12:23 < hotdogs> I have this problem where I want to go to arcades
12:24 < hotdogs> but when I get there I realize I really don't want to pay per play
12:24 < swiss> i need to acquire money, then we can definitely go
12:24 < hotdogs> and the games aren't the kind that I really enjoy anymore
12:24 < zero-one> hotdogs: it gets kinda expensive
12:24 < hotdogs> except lightgun games, since you can't get them at home
12:24 < zero-one> quickly
12:24 < swiss> hotdogs: round one is perfect cause you loaded the money onto a card already
12:24 < swiss> and you dont think of it as cash anymore
12:25 < swiss> i won a shit ton of tickets last time with airen and mendez
12:25 < hotdogs> get lots of tickets, acquire 100 bouncy balls
12:25 < hotdogs> realize you could have bought 100 bouncy balls at dollar tree
12:25 < swiss> exactly
12:26 < hotdogs> throw them down the dorm hallway
12:26 < swiss> oh, i only played one ticket game
12:26 < swiss> just won >100 tickets my one time playing it
12:26 < zero-one> hotdogs: omw in 3 minutes
12:27 < hotdogs> tickets are like gambling for children except you never make money
12:27 < swiss> but r1 has a bunch of games you wont find elsewhere
12:27 < swiss> its worth going to
12:27 < hotdogs> that's true
12:27 < hotdogs> and they still have the yen prices on them
12:27 < hotdogs> LEGITTTTT
12:27 < swiss> lolol
12:27 < swiss> giant touchscreen games
12:27 < hotdogs> also, they had ghost squad when I went
12:27 < hotdogs> which I might as well play at home.  but still
12:28 < swiss> i think i have ~$5 left in credits
12:28 < swiss> if we go for bowling, and arcade a bit on the side, it would be reasonable
12:29 < swiss> dont know what karaoke there is like
12:29 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm headed for the pole
12:29 < hotdogs> oak tree is so much closer
12:30 < swiss> true
12:30 < swiss> we'll see, soonest i'll be in pomona will be aug 18th, so no rush
12:35 < swiss> http://www.reddit.com/r/cosplay/comments/wzcd0/my_friends_riven_cosplay_from_league_of_legends/
12:35 < swiss> gradius: i want that skin ^^
13:39 < gradius> I want pulsfire treatment on Riven.
13:39 < gradius> Some form of an angelic skin would b sweeet.
13:41 < DrItanium> gradius: Why omit the e of be when you injected into the sweeet?
13:41 < DrItanium> you save nothing
13:41 < gradius> DrItanium: That was actually a typo
13:41 < gradius> I didn't mean to omit the e.
13:41 < gradius> :)
13:41 < DrItanium> Right! Sure!
13:41 < DrItanium> Totally fucking believe that
13:41 < DrItanium> ;)
13:41 < gradius> I actually hate taking out letters of words :P
13:51 < hotdogs> gradius: you want her skin?????????????
13:51 < DrItanium> It puts the lotion on it's skin or else it gets the hose again
13:51 < hotdogs> ITS
13:51 < airen> SHUT UP TITTY MONSTER
13:52 < DrItanium> airen: GOD DAMNIT AIREN
13:54 < gradius> dude.
13:54 < gradius> i'd tap that riven.
13:54 < gradius> I almost said
13:54 < gradius> id tap that airen
13:54 < gradius> because I was reading his name while typing.
13:54 < DrItanium> Cooperative ADHD?
13:56 < airen> lawl
15:20 < airen> Oh god.

15:24 < hotdogs> was I using |:| as a smiley for a while
15:25 < hotdogs> I can't remember what it was
15:27 < airen> I laughed pretty hard when I found it.
15:33 < zero-one> airen: found a backdoor in what?
15:40 < airen> zero-one: Just a php script
15:44 < timmah> hotdogs: wanna get water?
15:44 < hotdogs> suuuuure
15:44 < timmah> I'll meet you at the elevator
15:44 < hotdogs> alright
15:45 < prometheusx> i want to meet for water!
16:23 < gradius> hotdogs: it was a ninja
16:51 < hotdogs> gradius: oh right
19:28 < gradius> Installing DayZ on the laptop, and I'll try and update at home, I really wanna play now. Sadly wont be home till late.
19:28 < gradius> SO WHO WANTS TO PLAY WITH ME AT LIKE 11? :D
19:32 < gradius> also getting 20MB/s @ riot. <3
19:37 < hotdogs> DO THEY HAVE GIG?
19:37 < airen> GEEG
22:15 < swiss> lol
22:45 < zero-one> why do i need perl to emerge gentoo-sources?
22:45 < zero-one> gradius: if this emerge finishes by 11 i'll play with you
22:46 < zero-one> oh god this is sad
22:46 < zero-one> i have a gentoo install that i can't even boot into without a live cd
22:48 < alexjandro> super secure
22:49 < zero-one> alexjandro: everything is aes'd, and i don't have an initial ramdisk built for decrypting everything yet
22:58 < swiss> zero-one: have you tried installing gentoo *without* all this special stuff?
23:02 < zero-one> swiss: no
23:03 < zero-one> going balls deep the first time around
23:03 < zero-one> awwww yeah
23:04 < zero-one> should i tell menuconfig that my processor is a core 2? i have an i7
23:05 < alexjandro> yes
23:05 < alexjandro> and that you have 1000 cores
23:09 < swiss> zero-one: i'll be impressed if you have it fully working within 24 hours
23:09 < swiss> not in an insulting way, but legitimately impressed
23:10 < zero-one> swiss: i'm not planning on getting it to work in 24 hours
23:10 < zero-one> i mean... i have it installed
23:10 < zero-one> it's just booting that's the problem
23:10 < swiss> lol
23:10 < zero-one> which i can still do from a livecd, but you know
23:11 < swiss> -j5 for you if that was your question ealier
23:11 < zero-one> ...
23:11 < zero-one> no
23:11 < zero-one> it wasn't
23:11 < swiss> lol
23:11 < zero-one> i'm good with -j7 or -j8
23:11 < swiss> oh, more threads, derp
23:12 < swiss> i use the amazing -j2
23:12 < swiss> on my blazing pentium m
23:14 < swiss> i wonder if we could set up distcc on your computer
23:15 < zero-one> swiss: we could, but with what other machines?
23:16 < swiss> my laptop~
23:17 < zero-one> lol
23:17 < swiss> your computer as a distcc server when it is not logged in
23:17 < zero-one> lol
23:17 < zero-one> GET YOUR OWN PROCESSING POWER BITCH
23:18 < zero-one> it'd be fucking cool if i could get my 360 to do some work
23:18 < swiss> BUT YOU HAVE EXTRA
23:18 < swiss> distcc was a bitch between distros for me
23:18 < swiss> mendez knows cross compiling though
23:19 < alexjandro> swiss: Hey you're EE
23:19 < alexjandro> swiss: What the fuck is a "Solid State"
23:19 < swiss> alexjandro: not spinning disc
23:20 < alexjandro> Not in HDD
23:20 < swiss> in what context then
23:21 < alexjandro> Electronics
23:21 < swiss> -_-
23:21 < swiss> it means no moving components tmk
23:23 < alexjandro> http://i.imgur.com/uCwOa.png
23:23 < alexjandro> Now in that contex
23:24 < zero-one> swiss: i've set up a cross compiler before
23:24 < zero-one> i'm cs motherfucker, i can work this
23:25 < swiss> means a semiconductor not a mechanical switch
23:25 < swiss> zero-one: please do, i had issues with it
23:26 < swiss> kegel.com might help you, he has some cross compiling documentation
23:31 < swiss> how powerful is the xbox360 really? its the gpu thats powerful, not the processor, right?
23:31 < swiss> might not be worth it
23:38 < hotdogs> brb cross compiling on a cpu from 2005
23:39 < swiss> hotdogs: would help my cpu from 2002 though
23:39 < hotdogs> pretty sure that thing is hopeless
23:40 < swiss> prettymuch
23:40 < swiss> wanna buy me a new laptop
23:42 < swiss> or a suggestion of a good quad core lightweight small laptop
23:43 < alexjandro> swiss: Acer 7741G-7017
23:47 < swiss> alexjandro: i dont trust you
23:47 < zero-one> hotdogs: the 360 has a tri core PPC
23:47 < zero-one> what's so bad about that
23:50 < hotdogs> it's ancient
23:50 < hotdogs> also, who are you riding with to defcon
23:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm trying to figure that out now
--- Day changed Tue Jul 24 2012
00:00 < alexjandro> zero-one: chrislz needs a ride too
00:01 < prometheusx> chrislz: should talk to gradius if he wants to go down on wednesday
00:01 < prometheusx> supposedly he's goin on wednesday
00:03 < alexjandro> i think he has a ride with davie
00:04 < alexjandro> idk
00:04 < prometheusx> alexjandro: well all i know is you're taking me on wednesday
00:05 < alexjandro> yes
00:05 < alexjandro> and leaving you there
00:05 < prometheusx> yes, i'll be broke and in vegas
00:13 < gradius> Tribes: Ascend | Amount of Sleep Each Night: Descend
00:13 < gradius> My boss' facebook status.
00:13 < hotdogs> how dare you play without me
00:13 < hotdogs> oh
00:13 < gradius> haha.
00:14 < gradius> Im still getting used to the damn skiing thing.

10:37 < mendez> swiss: I AM CROSS COMPILING
10:38 < swiss> mendez: lololol
10:38 < airen> I'm likely going to get a T420
10:38 < mendez> airen: i've actually been pretty impressed with some of the 'ultrabooks'
10:42 < airen> mendez: I've not been impressed.
10:42 < airen> I couldn't care less about how thin something is.
10:42 < airen> I need a good keyboard and duribility.
10:42 < mendez> i have to say my macbook is durable as fuck
10:43 < mendez> idk about the screen (seems like it wouldn't handle sheer forces well)
10:43 < mendez> but the body is pretty good
10:44 < timmah> mendez: which gen macbook?
10:45 < mendez> the one right before the retina ones
10:45 < timmah> the screens on those are pretty tough iirc
10:46 < timmah> never saw dead rows/columns on those
10:51 < airen> mendez: I can't buy a macbook because I don't suck dongs for cash.
10:52 < mendez> airen: you gotta admit though, it's a lot of cash
10:52 < airen> Truth.
10:52 < airen> You need a lot to afford a macbook though.
10:53 < swiss> thats a lot of dongs
10:53 < swiss> but chicklet
11:54 < timmah> swiss: sounds like you're an expert in this
11:54 < swiss> timmah: nah, i dont have a macbook
12:00 < DrItanium> My idea laptop would be: 2880x1440 resolution, 15.4 inch, hex-core processor, 32-gigs of ram, multiantenna wireless card, mechanical latch keyboard (cherry mx black), two or more hard drive bays, usb 3.0, dual displayport (fullsized) outputs, a gpu with at least 2 gigs of ram, and a weight of less than 6 lbs
12:01 < swiss> DrItanium: not a butterfly keyboard?
12:01 < DrItanium> Go for the gold man
12:01 < DrItanium> mechanical latch
12:02 < DrItanium> Oh! And unlocked EFI
12:03 < DrItanium> Minus the mechanical latch keyboard this kind of a machine isn't far off
12:03 < swiss> gonna go google mechanical latch keyboard
12:03 < DrItanium> >_>
12:03 < swiss> oh wait, is that like model m?
12:03 < DrItanium> yes
12:03 < DrItanium> clickity clack
12:04 < DrItanium> My keyboard for my desktop has cherry mx reds
12:04 < swiss> ah
12:04 < DrItanium> But blacks are the best if you're a serious typist
12:04 < swiss> butterfly is a different trait, so lets add it on for fun
12:04 < swiss> :P
12:04 < DrItanium> I know what butterfly is
12:05 < swiss> so a butterflying mechanical latch
12:05 < DrItanium> That would be pretty difficult to engineer
12:08 < airen> DrItanium: Sounds simiarl to mine.
12:08 < DrItanium> I just took my desktop, removed the raid card and second processor and bluray drive
12:08 < airen> But I'd have buckling springs (or topre or cherry really as long as it was decently sized and didn't suck) and coreboot.
12:08 < airen> Also I'd want less horsepower, more battery
12:09 < DrItanium> you would be suprised what can be accomplished
12:09 < DrItanium> the screen would be the biggest power draw as Kepler is actually very power efficient and scalable
12:10 < airen> I'd want something like a pixel Qi screen
12:10 < swiss> i want 2 laptops
12:10 < DrItanium> ???
12:10 < swiss> powerful midsized
12:10 < swiss> batterylife lightweight
12:11 < DrItanium> Well I would want as much horsepower as possible in a 5.5-6 lbs weight range
12:11 < DrItanium> This would be high technology already
12:12 < DrItanium> So whos to say it would even be x86 based
12:12 < DrItanium> not ia64 as that would melt through a table
12:12 < airen> DrItanium: Fuuuuck yeah.
12:12 < airen> I'd be totally down for a different architecture.
12:12 < DrItanium> Not arm or mips either
12:12 < DrItanium> It would have to be a new design
12:13 < airen> What about the new chinese one?
12:13 < DrItanium> Longsoon?
12:13 < airen> Not Loongsoon, but the shanghai.
12:13 < DrItanium> one second...
12:13  * DrItanium looks up this new processor
12:14 < airen> DrItanium: There is also arm64 to consider.
12:14 < DrItanium> With 31 GPRs...lol no
12:14 < DrItanium> This would be like an EDGE hybrid
12:14 < swiss> someday babbyswiss will understand the big boys conversation
12:15 < airen> DrItanium: Wait...
12:15 < airen> arm64 only has 31gprs?
12:15 < airen> what
12:15 < DrItanium> yup
12:15 < airen> Who thought this was a good idea...
12:15 < DrItanium> ARM did
12:15 < airen> -_-;
12:15 < DrItanium> Not 32...31
12:16 < airen> what the fuck
12:17 < airen> What's the reasoning?
12:17 < airen> (also why not mips64)
12:17 < DrItanium> Not sure
12:17 < DrItanium> MIPS is a jack of all trades
12:17 < DrItanium> I would want something that is exotic and powerful (an EDGE like cpu)
12:18 < DrItanium> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_Data_Graph_Execution
12:19 < airen> WaveScalar
12:19 < airen> Heh
12:20 < DrItanium> ?
12:20 < airen> In that article.
12:20 < airen> That's a cool name.
12:20 < DrItanium> oh!
12:20 < airen> DrItanium: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ShenWei (that's the name of it!)
12:21 < DrItanium> Probably would be something like a series of super simple cores overlayed with an EPIC ISA and executes like EDGE internally
12:22 < airen> DrItanium: Looks like an Alpha copy
12:25 < airen> DrItanium: Maybe you need to design the next ISA!
12:29 < DrItanium> airen: Dat processor is superscalar...nanny cpu
12:30 < DrItanium> Four-issue superscalar.....
12:31 < DrItanium> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbrus_2000 <- FUCK YES
12:31 < DrItanium> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbrus-2C%2B <- 25 W power consumption!
12:32 < airen> D:
12:32 < DrItanium> or go with the Elbrus2000 and have 6 watts of power consumption
12:32 < airen> Interesting.
12:32 < DrItanium> DAT VLIW UNF
12:33 < airen> DrItanium: How about a kittson laptop? :P
12:33 < DrItanium> Would melt through the desk
12:34 < DrItanium> But it would be so awesome while it's melting through said desk
12:34 < airen> DrItanium: POWER laptop?
12:34 < DrItanium> POWER or PowerPC?
12:34 < airen> POWER
12:34 < airen> POWER8
12:34 < DrItanium> That would be pretty awesome
12:35 < DrItanium> I think that would fall under desktop replacement though
12:35 < airen> Maybe they need to tweak it to be lowPOWER
12:35 < DrItanium> I have to invoke my hipsterness by saying it's still a nanny cpu
12:35 < DrItanium> lol lowPOWER
12:35 < airen> The system used 32 32-bit integer registers and another 32 64-bit floating point registers, each in their own unit. The branch unit also included a number of "private" registers for its own use, including the program counter.
12:36 < DrItanium> see "private" registers
12:36 < airen> What do you mean "nanny" cpu
12:36 < DrItanium> It schedules instructions for you
12:36 < airen> Oh.
12:36 < airen> As opposed to how Itanium does it.
12:36 < DrItanium> It presents the idea of one instruction executed at a time even though internally it's doing analysis and executing shit in parallel if possible (superscalar)
12:37 < airen> Right.
12:37 < DrItanium> VLIW exposes the microarchitecture directly and it's up to the compiler to handle every last detail
12:37 < DrItanium> A big pain in the ass for a company like Intel, so they don't use it

12:38 < DrItanium> EPIC takes a little bit of an abstraction and defines fixed size bundles, an ISA, and a frontend to abstract the functional unit counts away from the program <- INSTANT BONER
12:38 < DrItanium> Yup, I've read this. It's about the MAGIC progject
12:39 < DrItanium> *project
12:39 < DrItanium> Oh this is something else
12:40 < DrItanium> I call VLIW, gentoo on a chip because it needs to be riced out

18:25 < hotdogs> I figured
18:58 < zero-one> hotdogs: gradius: any tips for speeding emerges?
18:58 < hotdogs> -j 10
18:58 < gradius> buy a faster computer
18:59 < zero-one> i have a quad core with hyperthreading. is -j8 alright to use?
18:59 < hotdogs> fuck yeah
18:59 < zero-one> i've been using -j7
19:00 < hotdogs> no not the make option
19:00 < hotdogs> you can have emerge build packages in parallel
19:00 < zero-one> oh
19:00 < hotdogs> they also have one that uses load, which might be a better idea
19:00 < hotdogs> if you're only building one package you're kind of fucked
19:01 < hotdogs> but for our stuff we were mostly limited by ebuild.sh
19:01 < hotdogs> so running 10 packages at a time made things go a lot faster
19:01 < zero-one> ok, so --jobs numberofjobs
19:01 < hotdogs> yes
19:02 < zero-one> got it
19:02 < hotdogs> and if they can be built in parallel, they will be
19:02 < hotdogs> which isn't always a lot
19:34 < zero-one> hotdogs: http://en.gentoo-wiki.com/wiki/DM-Crypt_with_LUKS#Booting_from_usb-stick
19:34 < zero-one> i'm using extlinux to boot from a usb drive
19:34 < zero-one> and they reference an extlinux.conf in the guide
19:35 < zero-one> and i'm looking for an example conf
19:35 < zero-one> and can't find one anywhere
19:37 < zero-one> i could just google and write my own, but i'd like to see the one they're referencing
19:44 < zero-one> this has to be a bug
19:44 < zero-one> it should be creating a default conf
19:44 < zero-one> FUUUUUUUU

13:41 < timmah> last I saw they were at 8:60
13:42 < timmah> I think CBS did a story on them, or something
13:58 < swiss> i have like .00001 bitcoins
14:00 < timmah> I sold all mine a while back
14:00 < timmah> I just need to switch markets and get my cash out
14:08 < airen> timmah: Did you lose money all together?
14:15 < timmah> airen: at this point in time...
14:15 < timmah> I think I made back all but 700
14:15 < timmah> So in a sense, the box I used cost $700
14:15 < airen> Not bad at all.
14:15 < timmah> I can start grinding again (Which I probably will do) and drop that price lower
14:15 < airen> Fuuuuck yeah.
14:15 < timmah> Hell, I could sell off two of the cards and make a profit
14:16 < timmah> I'd still have a kick ass rig
14:16 < timmah> I think that'll be my plan for the weekend, get it running again
14:17 < timmah> set up a vpn at home so It can call back and I can remotely manage it
14:17 < timmah> also throw up hashcat jobs for jbest and stuff
14:18 < timmah> At my last known rate and coin price, I could pay off the box completely by Nov
14:21 < airen> Not bad.
14:22 < timmah> It's a shame I'm lazy

14:30 < swiss> except arko. He just always does his cool ideas it seems
14:30 < timmah> ./shame
14:31 < DrItanium> Using a Doom Engine trick to identify cycles in a flow graph
14:31 < DrItanium> aww yeah!
14:31 < DrItanium> Well inspiration that is
14:32 < timmah> swiss: and DrItanium.
14:32 < timmah> damn you people with motivation!
14:32 < DrItanium> oh lol
14:32 < DrItanium> this "trick" also creates acyclic paths in a loop too!
14:34 < DrItanium> GO LINKER GO!
14:34 < DrItanium> 112 megs and rising
14:37 < swiss> FUCK YOU MOTIVATED PEOPLE
14:37 < swiss> timmah: we should start a movement against motivation
14:37 < swiss> later
14:37 < swiss> cause I don't feel like it right now
14:40 < DrItanium> >_>
14:45 < airen> I GET IT
14:45 < airen> DrItanium: Awww yeah, link dat shit.
14:46 < DrItanium> Well I came up with the idea myself but here is the influence
14:48 < DrItanium> fuuuu
14:50 < DrItanium> http://doom.wikia.com/wiki/Making_a_self-referencing_sector
14:51 < DrItanium> The linking broke...not sure how to tell llvm-ld to reference glibc :/

10:10 < swiss> thoughts
10:11 < timmah> >console
10:11 < swiss> timmah: but it comes rooted
10:11 < swiss> and open source
10:11 < swiss> and quad core console for $100
10:12 < timmah> But my computer can already do better
10:12 < swiss> think of it as a nice $100 media server that also plays video games
10:12 < timmah> Raspberry pi was ~40 bucks for my media server
10:12 < timmah> or just use my desktop
10:13 < timmah> As a whole, for most people, I think the console is a great idea
10:13 < timmah> I'm all for this thing becoming great
10:13 < timmah> but it's not for me
10:13 < swiss> k, moreso looking for opinions on whether it will succeed
10:14 < timmah> 5.6mil of the 1mil goal? It'll do something that's for sure
10:14 < timmah> I don't know if it will become a contender
10:14 < timmah> but it will be out there, like mame arcades
10:15 < swiss> i'm considering getting one
10:15 < swiss> i mean, i need quad core processing power to watch some of the videos I have
10:15 < swiss> a raspberry pi won't do it
10:15 < timmah> gradius(+cnt)]
10:15 < timmah> [#testgradius]
10:15 < timmah> er
10:15 < timmah> http://goo.gl/wfXRn
10:16 < timmah> raspberry pi will do x264 decoding on a 1080p
10:16 < swiss> but it won't decode HI10P
10:17 < timmah> the hell profile is that?
10:17 < timmah> oh.
10:17 < swiss> 10 bit color depth
10:17 < timmah> really?
10:17 < timmah> why?
10:18 < swiss> Lots of my anime is that way, but it can't be decoded by most graphics cards
10:18 < swiss> and therefore has to be completely decoded by the processor
10:18 < swiss> http://blisswater.info/comparison/elephantsdream/ 10bit vs 8bit
10:19 < swiss> look at the aliasing difference
10:19 < timmah> I barely see a difference
10:19 < swiss> it's barely there, but on an animated video (not still frames) it makes a bigger difference
10:20 < timmah> and 8bit looks better in some parts
10:20 < swiss> in the end, i have videos like that that I need decoded
10:20 < swiss> and i need a quad core processor to do it
10:20 < timmah> yeah, in the end it's from the source
10:20 < timmah> and you can't really change that
10:21 < swiss> and this box seems to be a perfect media server solution for that
10:21 < swiss> like hell i'm funding it on kickstarter though
10:21 < swiss> if it comes out I might
10:21 < timmah> swiss: do you have a ps3?
10:22 < timmah> you can use ps3 media server to do transcoding
10:23 < timmah> also, is there an opencl implementation of hi10p?
10:23 < swiss> nope, i own no game system
10:24 < swiss> and i have no idea
10:25 < timmah> if there is an opencl, use a gpu
10:25 < timmah> it'd be faster than a cpu
10:26 < swiss> well, apparently GPUs jsut can't yet
10:26  * swiss is just parroting, he doesn't know the reasons why
10:30 < timmah> I think your encoder is being a hipster
10:30 < timmah> because I couldn't tell any difference when I was 5 feet from my screen
10:32 < timmah> fuck it, go Hi444PP
10:39 < swiss> timmah: just saying, if that's the direction video is going, no fucking way am I buying something that won't be able to play new vidoes in a year or two
10:40 < timmah> I don't think it is. h/x264 is nicer for everything else and they're already working on h265 which will have elements of the hi10p
10:40 < timmah> also the wikientry says:
10:40 < timmah> Going beyond typical mainstream consumer product capabilities
10:41 < timmah> lol'd at mainstream
10:54 < timmah> It might be the future for anime, i dono
10:54 < timmah> airen would know that
10:56 < airen> All depends on what fansubbers go with.
10:56 < airen> Already anime is uniq in adapting hi10p
10:57 < airen> I spelled unique uniq...
10:57 < airen> Too much bash.
10:59 < timmah> just the right amount
11:01 < airen> All bash all day.
20:18 < DrItanium> I have to put in my two cents on this
20:18 < DrItanium> Newer video cards from nvidia can do 10bit in hardware.
20:19 < DrItanium> I know they added 30-bit color space support in newer versions of the nvidia driver
20:19 < DrItanium> Anyway, back to my convalescence...damn stress
21:54 < airen> DrItanium: Woah woah woah woah wut?
21:54 < airen> Fuck, I may have to buy nvidia once again...

13:55 < timmah> mendez: lol
13:55 < timmah> if only I could sell mine...
13:55 < mendez> you can sell them
13:56 < mendez> in face it wouldn't mind buying some off you now that I have a source of income
13:56 < timmah> sounds like a plan to me
13:56 < mendez> how many do you have?
13:57  * mendez wishes he had money to buy them from you when they weren't worth as much :/
13:57 < timmah> 100ish?
13:57 < timmah> yeah, I sold a bunch when they were at $6
13:57 < mendez> it'd be about $800 if i bought em all right?
13:58 < timmah> I'd have to check, but thereabouts
13:58 < mendez> when i get back from defcon and I get my next paycheck i'll buy some off ya
13:58 < timmah> coolio
13:59 < timmah> let me know when and I'll load them onto my phone
13:59 < timmah> actually, even though the coins went up in price, you'll still get the same stuff
14:00 < timmah> most stuff you can buy is locked to a usd price, which is translated into btc
14:00 < mendez> yeah, i'm not sweating it
14:01 < airen> lolololol
14:01 < airen> mendez: WHATCHA GOING TO DO WITH ALL DEM BUTTCOINS?
14:01 < mendez> DONATE THEM TO CHARITY

10:45 < zero-one> timmah: really?
10:46 < zero-one> where did you read that?
10:47 < timmah> Civil Code Section 1950.5(c)
10:48 < zero-one> A landlord may not demand or receive security, however denominated, in an amount or value in
10:48 < zero-one> excess of an amount equal to two months' rent, in the case of unfurnished residential property, and an

10:49 < zero-one> FUUUUUUUU

12:21 < timmah> OKAY
15:14 < hotdogs> gradius: are you guys doing your code jam shit on the live system?
15:15 < hotdogs> I only ask because of the mysterious http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/xk9o6/has_anybody_been_banned_permanently_suspended_in/
15:23 < zero-one> hotdogs: gradius: http://youtu.be/GA85IsVR6Zo
15:23 < zero-one> fucking lol'd so hard
15:25 < hotdogs> yes, yes
15:35 < gradius> hotdogs: nothing should be run on live.
15:35 < gradius> lol
15:35 < hotdogs> ;) ;) ;)
15:36 < hotdogs> I guess that started yesterday so nevermind
15:44 < zero-one> hotdogs: http://youtu.be/h-GZ5BCr8D8
15:46 < airen> zero-one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LlYs_s1494
15:47 < DrItanium> gradius: But what about agile development? You should bring the customer into your code jam
15:47 < DrItanium> Break something badly....blame it on the client not describing what they wanted clearly enough :)
15:57 < hotdogs> then when the client stops paying you money, blame it on the client
16:12 < gradius> DrItanium: lolol
16:13 < DrItanium> hotdogs: But it is the client's fault for not be descriptive enough that they wanted stability
16:27 < prometheusx> hotdogs: timmah did you guys have chipotle and start a race?
16:28 < gradius> Question for you guys
16:28 < gradius> Linux applications for intercepting + manipulating traffic?
16:29 < timmah> like ids/ips?
16:29 < gradius> IE: I want to run a linux VM as my router
16:29 < gradius> and intercept the traffic + change some packets
16:29 < gradius> I guess ettercap would be a good one.
16:32 < airen> iptables
16:32 < gradius> Yeah, the routing part isn't so mcuh of an issue
16:32 < zero-one> gradius: ettercap
16:32 < gradius> it's editing some of th network traffic
16:34 < airen> What kind of editing?
16:34 < airen> Because iptables has a mangle table.
16:35 < gradius> mangle might work.
16:44 < mendez> why would you need ettercap? iptables should be able to do everything
16:45 < mendez> ettercap = paloaltonetworks--
16:45 < hotdogs> "everything"
16:46 < hotdogs> mangle chains are pretty limited
16:46 < hotdogs> without being willing to write a module, I mean
16:46 < zero-one> ^this
17:58 < hotdogs> so how's it goin fellas
17:59 < prometheusx> hotdogs: you still exploding from both ends?
18:02 < hotdogs> both ends of what
18:02 < prometheusx> of you
18:02 < hotdogs> my feet and my hair? yes.
21:17 < DrItanium> zero-one: I integrated an expert system in alephone. What should I do with it?
21:17 < DrItanium> *into
21:21 < zero-one> you...
21:21 < zero-one> you what
21:21 < zero-one> why
21:22 < DrItanium> Because it's easy and I can
21:22 < DrItanium> I haven't linked it into the alephone code base but it is added into the executable
21:22 < zero-one> i have no clue what you should do with it
21:23 < DrItanium> I'm in the same boat as you
21:23 < DrItanium> I was thinking of trying to improve the AI but I'm not sure. Or add the ability to have thief like sneaking or even monster infighting
21:44 < gradius> DrItanium: you're crazy.
21:49 < hotdogs> but then the AI will learn how to win

11:13 < hotdogs> it's one of those games that lives in my imagination that I never actually play
11:13 < timmah> wait, it'll be a seperate game?
11:13 < timmah> no loger a mod?
11:13 < timmah> I did not realize this
11:13 < gradius> yes not a mod at all

11:15 < timmah> ...
11:15 < timmah> fuckit
11:16 < hotdogs> not like we're playing anyway

11:18 < hotdogs> do you still want to play
11:21 < timmah> the urge rises every so often
11:21 < hotdogs> you get an urge, but you never want to play enough to actually play
11:21 < timmah> it takes too long to get into the game
11:22 < timmah> tribes is nearly instant in comparison
11:22 < hotdogs> so what you're saying is you don't actually want to play

23:44 < gradius> hotdogs: what games were you talking about?
23:44 < alexjandro> gradius: RPG
23:44 < alexjandro> sexy RPG
23:45 < gradius> rocket propelled grenade?
23:45 < hotdogs> gradius: lol?
23:45 < hotdogs> I don't know why I ask, I hate that game
23:45 < gradius> yes!
23:45 < gradius> lets play
23:45 < gradius> :)
23:47 < hotdogs> mumble
23:48 < gradius> k sec
23:48 < gradius> telling rom the difference bt jre and jdk
23:49 < alexjandro> zero-one: are we still on for the telecom lab tomorrow
23:50 < hotdogs> also what mumble servers do you have
23:50 < hotdogs> zero's is still dead
23:50 < alexjandro> hotdogs: you should host one on campus
23:50 < hotdogs> good idea
23:51 < alexjandro> you'd have the lowest lag
23:51 < hotdogs> I'll get right on that
23:51 < alexjandro> goof
23:51 < alexjandro> good*
23:51 < hotdogs> I wouldn't use it at work though
23:51 < alexjandro> of course not, for personal use only
23:51 < hotdogs> oh
23:51 < hotdogs> that sounds wrong
23:52 < alexjandro> i think i used the wrong word
23:52 < alexjandro> im tired
23:52 < gradius> so I hit the windows key to launch mumble
23:52 < gradius> and i acutally typed mamble
23:52 < gradius> in the search
23:52 < gradius> before I realized what I was doign

14:50 < timmah> grooveip works great for me
14:50 < timmah> I only have issues with one person though
14:50 < timmah> and that's because iphones suck

14:29 < gradius> we were searching when they were disable
14:29 < gradius> d
14:29 < gradius> we need to try again
14:29 < hotdogs> nah
14:29 < hotdogs> when I played with timmah we were looking
14:29 < hotdogs> we found a bike once
14:30 < hotdogs> unless there's a ton more servers, the problem is that the first person to get a car working has it easy getting the other cars
14:30 < hotdogs> then they collect them all and no one else on that server gets one
16:17 < zero-one> swiss: i'm coming back saturday night
16:17 < zero-one> so i can make it
16:17 < alexjandro> gradius: read my text
16:17 < swiss> zero-one: good man
16:17 < alexjandro> gradius: you should go to the office on Tuesday
16:19 < zero-one> swiss: so what's the plan?
16:20 < swiss> zero-one: depends. I dunno what chrislz is doing
16:22 < zero-one> swiss: you invite any chicks?
16:22 < swiss> i kindasorta invited one, but I'm pretty sure she can't come
16:23 < zero-one> lol
16:23 < swiss> and I have one who would probably come by and hang out for a while
16:27 < alexjandro> hotdogs: timmah you around
16:27 < alexjandro> wait fuk
16:27 < alexjandro> fuck
16:27 < alexjandro> you're not on campus

16:30 < alexjandro> gradius: Hi
16:30 < alexjandro> Im sad

16:38 < alexjandro> long*
16:38 < alexjandro> SO WE CAN STILL GET LUNCH!
16:38 < alexjandro> YAY!
16:38 < gradius> YUP
16:38 < gradius> at 12
16:38 < gradius> lets do it
16:38 < alexjandro> AND YOU CAN SHOW ME THE STUDIO
16:40 < gradius> (kindof)
16:40 < gradius> and if you sign NDA
16:40 < alexjandro> Who cares, I'll sign anything
16:40 < alexjandro> Without reading
16:40 < gradius> (note to self, include car title in NDA)
16:41 < alexjandro> Go ahead, my laptop is worth more than car
16:41 < gradius> lolol
17:57 < DrItanium> gradius: The question isn't can you sign an NDA. It's more like I can't put enough quotation marks around "We own you if you sign this"
17:57 < DrItanium> So I won't try
17:58 < DrItanium> *We won't own you if you sign this
20:00 < chrislz> swiss: im down for w/e
21:23 < zero-one> hotdogs: do you know a guy that works for I&IT by the name of "Curtis Clark"?
21:24 < hotdogs> s/works/worked/
21:25 < zero-one> he was layed off?
21:25 < hotdogs> something like that
21:25 < hotdogs> he was a manager
21:25 < prometheusx> he was fired
21:25 < hotdogs> managers don't get laid off
21:25 < prometheusx> out of a cannon
21:25 < zero-one> ugh...
21:25 < hotdogs> why do you ask
21:26 < hotdogs> he went back to being a bio prof or something
21:35 < zero-one> because i need him to give me read/write privs on the AHC's web share
21:35 < zero-one> already emailed him, so we'll see what happens
21:42 < hotdogs> so I'm doing botwurst testing
21:42 < hotdogs> and I find it really amusing that I just dropped in the config reload command into the steve jobs action
21:42 < hotdogs> cause I didn't want to have to restart the bot a bunch of times
21:48 < hotdogs> zero-one: I wrote stuff to make botwurst ping mumble servers
21:48 < hotdogs> so I can see if anyone's on without starting mumble
21:48 < hotdogs> right now it's through ctcp...not sure what to do with it
21:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: ooooh
21:51 < zero-one> neat
21:53 < hotdogs> IF ONLY SOMEONE'S MUMBLE WASN'T DOWN
21:54 < hotdogs> also, want to see something cool?
21:55 < hotdogs> I made a script that responds to the mumble packets with random values
21:55 < hotdogs> so it looks wacky in the connect dialog
21:56 < zero-one> lolol
21:56 < zero-one> screenshot por favor
21:57 < zero-one> oh man
21:57 < zero-one> you know what time it is
21:57 < zero-one> http://youtu.be/5byXc0m-Ebo
21:59 < hotdogs> open mumble and add whywolf.net
21:59 < zero-one> oh yeah, turns out that dude is a bio professor
22:00 < zero-one> ou: Biological Sciences Department
22:00 < hotdogs> yep
22:00 < hotdogs> are you sure it's not http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cXBml2X6tA time
22:01 < zero-one> LOL
22:01 < zero-one> the user count goes nuts
22:01 < hotdogs> sending bullshit to 76.171.54.221:46741
22:01 < hotdogs> that's what it prints :)
22:01 < hotdogs> OMG YOUR IP
22:01 < hotdogs> OH NOS
22:01 < zero-one> i'm not at home
22:01 < zero-one> JOKE'S ON YOU
22:01 < hotdogs> also, you can't see the version
22:01 < hotdogs> but it's 6.66
22:02 < prometheusx> DEVIL VERSION
22:02 < zero-one> hotdogs: send the script to me
22:02 < hotdogs> the ping sends back a 4 byte version, # users, max users, max bandwidth
22:02 < hotdogs> I don't know why the client doesn't show that shit
22:03 < hotdogs> http://pastebin.com/NBzQy0m8
22:03 < hotdogs> HA HA HA YOU'LL NEVER LEARN MY SECRETS, I'VE ENCRYPTED THEM IN PERL
22:03 < hotdogs> jesus, the pastebin color choices are awful
22:04 < zero-one> wait a minute
22:05 < zero-one> so mumble gives this info out on a different port?
22:06 < zero-one> that would explain why you can't ever see my user count
22:06 < hotdogs> no, the regular port
22:06 < zero-one> oh
22:06 < zero-one> shoot
22:06 < hotdogs> I can't see your user count cause your shit's broken
22:06 < zero-one> well, now it is anyway..
22:06 < zero-one> i could go back a version i guess
22:06 < zero-one> if i REALLY wanted to
22:06 < zero-one> but we've got like.. a million mumble servers
22:07 < hotdogs> I'm not convinced that testing would really have a broken murmur version
22:07 < hotdogs> what if the others are down?
22:07 < hotdogs> WHAT IFFFFF
22:08 < zero-one> /usr/sbin/murmurd: symbol lookup error: /usr/sbin/murmurd: undefined symbol: _ZN3Ice6upCastEPNS_10ConnectionE
22:08 < hotdogs> hmmm if I had botwurst list the mumble status in a channel it would end up hitting highlights for the owners
22:09 < hotdogs> why don't you upgrade?
22:09 < zero-one> i did
22:09 < zero-one> i'm upgraded as far as i can go
22:11 < zero-one> googled, and it sounds reasonable that it's probably linked against the wrong zeroc-ice version
22:11 < hotdogs> I mean install the version from sid
22:11 < hotdogs> WOOOO
22:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: because the older version doesn't have 1.2.3
22:12 < zero-one> only 1.2.2
22:12 < hotdogs> yeah, and there's a new version in sid that's fixed
22:12 < hotdogs> http://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/mumble-server/download
22:13 < hotdogs> not like it can get more broken!
22:14 < zero-one> alright...
22:14 < zero-one> i guess i'll go for it
22:15 < airen> zero-one: are you installing .debs directly?
22:17 < hotdogs> FUCK YEAH
22:18 < DrItanium> zero-one: Sounds like you've got a C++ name mangling issue
22:23 < zero-one> airen: nope
22:23 < DrItanium> zero-one: You're missing a library of some kind
22:23 < DrItanium> or it's not the correct version
22:24 < swiss> prometheusx: you on?
22:31 < zero-one> hotdogs: i guess you were right
22:31 < zero-one> this version works
22:31 < zero-one> recording and all
22:32 < zero-one> Y U WRITE SCRIPT IN LANGUAGE I DON'T USE
22:32 < hotdogs> protocol 1.2.4
22:32 < DrItanium> zero-one: DEAL WITH IT
22:32 < hotdogs> now you know vetsin's secret
22:32 < zero-one> hahaha
22:32 < zero-one> i'm waiting to find out what doesn't work right
22:33 < DrItanium> JUMP IN AND FIND OUT BAM!
22:33 < zero-one> hotdogs: how about a game of settlers tonight?
22:33 < zero-one> with rainbows and maybe wedgie
22:33 < hotdogs> get two more
22:35 < hotdogs> also, I barely wrote any of that script
22:39 < zero-one> hotdogs: wedgie is helping rainbows pxeboot peppermint
22:39 < zero-one> but after he's done, they're good to play
22:39 < hotdogs> coolio
22:39 < DrItanium> Why would you try to pxeboot some candy? That just is going to gum things up
22:42 < hotdogs> is it possible to gum up rainbows any more?
22:42 < zero-one> DrItanium: what can i say, they're suckers for peppermint
22:43 < DrItanium> I could say taste the rainbow......
22:48 < airen> What are we playing?
22:49 < DrItanium> Easiest way to be an asshole to a console jockey is to put multiple spaces at the front of a file >_>
23:30 < alexjandro> hotdogs: what email client do you use?
23:31 < hotdogs> claws-mail
23:31 < hotdogs> it's too cool for you
23:31 < hotdogs> don't bother
23:31 < hotdogs> you can't compose HTML email in it
23:32 < airen> owned n00b
23:39 < alexjandro> Oh damn. I can't have my signature without tons of pictures in it!
23:40 < prometheusx> need those animated gifs
23:42 < alexjandro> No, need all those Partner and Certification Logos

10:57 < hotdogs> lolololo

10:59 < swiss> teamspeak is more stable than that xD
11:01 < timmah> zero-one: you're doing something wrong
11:02 < zero-one> swiss: OPEN SOURCE OR BUST
11:02 < timmah> swiss: aren't TS servers !free?
11:03 < swiss> dunno
11:03 < swiss> there's a linux server appliction
11:03 < swiss> it's what I run for some friends
11:04 < timmah> hm, that's new.
11:04 < timmah> maybe I'm thinking vent
11:04 < timmah> no, not vent.
11:04 < swiss> http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads/ linux server
11:04 < swiss> fully CLI
11:08 < airen> zero-one: Dig into why it's taking up so much ram.
11:09 < hotdogs> then submit a patch
11:09 < hotdogs> timmah: he's running a bleeding edge version
11:09 < timmah> swiss: eh, cli...
11:09 < timmah> hotdogs: oh, the nightly?
11:09 < hotdogs> no, sid
11:10 < hotdogs> swiss: you like bending over?
11:10 < zero-one> airen: i could. but where would i start if logs don't give me anything obvious?
11:10 < swiss> hotdogs: depends
11:11 < swiss> is it for you? ;)
11:11 < hotdogs> also, looks like teamspeak is only licensed for entities making money from it
11:11 < hotdogs> too bad teamspeak sucks
11:11 < hotdogs> zero-one: make a cronjob to restart it nightly, duh
11:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: nono, you don't understand
11:12 < zero-one> this isn't a memory leak
11:12 < airen> zero-one: You could also try umurmur
11:12 < zero-one> at least it doesn't feel like one
11:12 < hotdogs> umurmur is missing a ton of features
11:12 < hotdogs> zero-one: it uses that much memory on startup?
11:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: mumble-server is using 103M as soon as i start it
11:12 < zero-one> yes
11:12 < hotdogs> >new sysadmins using their intuition
11:13 < airen> zero-one: virtual or resident?
11:13 < zero-one> airen: the latter
11:13 < hotdogs> RES or VIRT?
11:13 < zero-one> er...
11:13 < zero-one> wait
11:13 < zero-one> let me re-read

11:14 < hotdogs> lolo
11:14 < hotdogs> wat, I just found a random vlc process floating around
11:15 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/zOAHT.png
11:15 < zero-one> 11160 under resident, and 105M under virtual
11:15 < hotdogs> try tuning down the number of clients
11:15 < hotdogs> and/or the bitrate
11:16 < airen> Both good ideas.
11:16 < zero-one> tried the bit rate, doesn't make a difference
11:16 < hotdogs> I'd guess it's allocating everything it's going to need
11:18 < zero-one> just tried lowering the number of clients allowed
11:18 < zero-one> that didn't do anything either
11:18 < timmah> swiss: you're running your ts server as root?
11:18 < timmah> BRB HACKAN

11:19 < swiss> glhf
11:19 < timmah> also why so many threads, do they explain that?
11:20 < swiss> nope
11:20 < swiss> i didn't read documentation, you kidding? :P
11:20 < swiss> I downloaded and executed

11:38 < zero-one> i don't have a "murmurd" binary/script
11:39 < zero-one> i have "murmur"
11:39 < zero-one> and "murmur-user-wrapper"
11:39 < swiss> murmurd -fag :P
11:41 < timmah> swiss: how mature.
11:41 < timmah> zero-one: where did you get the package?
11:41 < zero-one> timmah: sid
11:44 < hotdogs> the crappy part is that you don't really need the latest package, just a rebuilt one
11:44 < zero-one> hotdogs: you think I can get windows server from I&IT for use at the credit union for a discoutned price, or for free?
11:44 < hotdogs> actually, maybe the testing one would have the same issue
11:44 < hotdogs> lolwut
11:44 < timmah> zero-one: try the stand-alone?
11:44 < hotdogs> oh, you mean the software
11:44 < zero-one> er.. yeah

11:46 < airen> zero-one: I know, it makes sense.
11:46 < airen> But would I be me if I didn't talk shit 24/7?
11:46 < zero-one> lolol
11:46 < zero-one> timmah: this will be a completely new experience for me
11:47 < zero-one> never set up a windows server before
11:47 < timmah> zero-one: I did once
11:47 < timmah> I didn't like it at all
11:47 < zero-one> say goodbye to all of your precious money
11:47 < zero-one> mwaqhahahaha
11:48 < zero-one> oh god, i just walked into like... 10000 jew jokes
11:48 < timmah> zero-one: yep.
11:49 < timmah> zero-one: also the sid version is behind, I think
11:49 < zero-one> timmah: the fuck do you mean it's behind
11:49 < timmah> what version is your mumble server
11:49 < zero-one> sid is supposed to be bleeding edge
11:49 < timmah> is it 1.2.3-349?
11:49 < zero-one> no
11:49 < zero-one> 1.2.4
11:50 < timmah> http://packages.debian.org/sid/mumble-server ?
11:50 < airen> zero-one: Of course you walked into jew jokes. Just be a man and own it instead of hiding under a blanket.
11:52 < zero-one> timmah: yeah, that one i guess. but the version number reported to the client is 1.2.4
11:52 < timmah> hm
11:52 < timmah> hotdogs: isn't vetsin running 1.2.4?
11:52 < zero-one> timmah: yes
11:52 < zero-one> yes he is
11:53 < hotdogs> no he isn't
11:53 < hotdogs> 1.2.4 doesn't exist
11:53 < hotdogs> his server supports protocol version 1.2.4
11:53 < hotdogs> cause debian is running stuff from their repo
11:55 < zero-one> hotdogs: so are we waiting for alexjandro?
11:56 < zero-one> timmah: are you coming?
11:56 < hotdogs> probably?
11:56 < hotdogs> I want to go to a store as well though
11:56 < hotdogs> that's in montclair

15:49 < alexjandro> gradius tim
15:49 < alexjandro> time*
15:54 < swiss> gradius: you need to find a way to get Cristina Vee to come to a swift meeting
15:54 < swiss> voice actress for Riven
15:54 < swiss> but also cosplayed Haruhi in an amazing way apparently
15:54 < gradius> swiss: yes I know
15:54 < gradius> and yeah
15:55 < gradius> she's pretty cool
15:55 < gradius> never met any of the VAs in person though.
15:55 < swiss> well
15:55 < gradius> Just through email chat + whatnot
15:55 < swiss> that's your new job
15:55 < gradius> hahah
15:55 < gradius> But that means I have to go to the 3rd floor
15:55 < gradius> and I dont wan tto
15:56 < swiss> hmmmm... she's actually only a decent haruhi
15:56 < swiss> but widely recognized because she did it as a job
15:56 < swiss> http://blogs.laweekly.com/arts/Haruhi-9.jpg
16:03 < airen> Christina Vee sucks
16:10 < gradius> airen: you always have an opinion.
16:11 < gradius> and that's why I <3 you
16:11  * gradius nods.
16:30 < drboots> Ah, dub voice actresses
16:30 < airen> Ding.
16:30 < drboots> Makes me think of the shit job thats likely to come when PSO2 gets localized.
16:30 < airen> nothx.jpg.exe
16:31 < drboots> It would be better if they...you know, hired good talent, instead of people that can approximate to the Japanese voice?
16:32 < drboots> Man, its been to long since I logged back into my screen, need to clean it up
16:32 < gradius> drboots: so sad :(
16:32 < drboots> gradius: To which part?
16:35 < gradius> the voice acting part
16:36 < gradius> sry I was not on topic haha
16:36 < drboots> Oh, lol, both are horrible things, really, since its not my own VPS yet, and shitty VG VA talent ruins a good game, especially when the Japanese talent is top notch
16:37 < swiss> airen: i dgaf about her dub voice acting
16:37 < drboots> Sega went all out for VAs on PSO2, lots of higher end anime and game VAs
16:37 < swiss> she did the voice of Riven
16:38 < drboots> What's his name, a singer that played Megaman X in the last several MMX titles is in one of the voices you can select
16:38 < drboots> Shoutaro...something
16:38 < drboots> He did a lot more as well
16:39 < swiss> but the more i look into her... the less appealing she is
16:41 < drboots> swiss:  That's because she really isn't too appealing
16:42 < swiss> QQ
16:43 < drboots> I'll give her credit though, she's not THAT bad, sooner have her over, whats her name, I suck with names today
16:44 < drboots> buuuuut I wouldn't put her up to too much
16:46 < airen> It is bad.
16:46 < airen> Always.
16:46 < airen> because dubs
16:49 < drboots> airen: Never said dubs were good

01:17 < zero-one> oh, so exciting news
01:17 < zero-one> i'm changing my middle name
01:24 < alexjandro> to...?
01:26 < zero-one> what do you think
02:23 < swiss> superjew?
02:26 < zero-one> NO, FAGGOT
02:27 < zero-one> i'm changing my middle name to "Zero"
03:11 < swiss> ...
03:11 < swiss> will they let you?
03:11 < swiss> plus, you should just make your first name zero and your middle name david
03:11 < swiss> then I can call you zero and people won't even look at me strange :P
07:55 < hotdogs> first name zero, middle name one
08:23 < gradius> ...
08:23 < gradius> I just woke up from a dream where zero-one came to me crying
08:23 < gradius> about being adicted to lactate.
08:23 < gradius> :|
08:23 < hotdogs> why don't you dream about me
08:24 < gradius> dont fucking ask me
08:24 < hotdogs> why don't you dream about me
08:24 < gradius> more than 75% of that dream was about my ex :|
08:24 < hotdogs> oooooooooooooooooo
08:24 < gradius> she found something else to yell at me about.
08:26 < gradius> holy shit, buyvm added gentoo templates
08:35 < hotdogs> oh snap

09:24 < gradius> i didnt know screen said this
09:25 < gradius> Your inventory: 25680.pts-36.calpolyswift       (08/16/2011 04:51:10 PM)        (Dead ???)
09:25 < gradius> The dead screen touches you. Try 'screen -wipe'.
09:25 < gradius> You hear 1 distant explosion.
09:25 < gradius> This room is empty (/var/run/screen/S-gradius).
09:25 < gradius> hahahahaha
09:25 < gradius> that's awesaome
09:25 < gradius> awesome*
10:09 < hotdogs> yeah, nethack messages
10:15 < airen> Fuck yeah nethack messages.
10:19 < drboots> Ugh, the sooner this heat blows over, the better
10:38 < swiss> THIS HEAT IS NOTHING
10:39 < swiss> go to michigan for a week. That's supposedly mediocre heat
10:39 < swiss> I almost died, literally
10:41 < drboots> I dont handle heat well in my current condition
10:42 < drboots> The A/C in this house isn't too efficient either so my room is usually too hot to sleep in at night.  Have to sleep on the couches downstairs
10:44 < swiss> i haven't even turned on the A/C yet this summer
10:45 < swiss> start the day off right http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaU4kCReWck
10:50 < drboots> Havent browsed youtube for stuff like that in awhile
11:03 < mendez> gradius: i always turned off the use flag for nethack messages... NOT ANYMORE
11:07 < airen> mendez: Why would you do this...
11:07 < mendez> airen: BECAUSE IT'S CUTE
11:09 < airen> mendez: No, why would you disable the useflag.
11:09 < airen> Fuckin' love nethack
11:11 < mendez> airen: because when i'm setting USE flags it's serious business
11:12 < mendez> i should add +OFFENSIVE too
11:13 < airen> Fuck yeah.
11:19 < swiss> i don't have nethack messages on :X
11:19 < swiss> is it worth a -NavD world?
11:21 < airen> Sure why not.
11:21 < swiss> beause pentium M
11:21 < swiss> i'm thinking I'll just do it when i get my new lappy
11:27 < drboots> lol Chinese TV.  Theyre showing an aerial shot of the corpse of a bank robber shot dead.  theres a very light censor square over the body, but not over the very large trail of blood leading up to it
11:51 < alexjandro> gradius: where is a good place to eat out here
12:43 < DrItanium> swiss: or add the use flag to /etc/portage/package.use for screren specifically and do emerge -av screen
12:44 < DrItanium> Why the fuck would you re-emerge world. Even on a machine with 24 cores that's a dumb move
12:48 < airen> DrItanium: I did it when I changed my march flags.
12:49 < DrItanium> But this is a use flag
12:49 < DrItanium> not CFLAGS
12:49 < DrItanium> I understand for CFLAGS
12:49 < DrItanium> or CXXFLAGS, or ICC_CFLAGS, etc
12:52 < swiss> DrItanium:  -NavD only will re-emerge things that the Use flag changed
12:53 < swiss> that's what -N does
12:54 < DrItanium> But that's assuming that you're putting the use flag into USE within /etc/make.conf
12:54 < DrItanium> I realize it will still do the same thing
12:54 < swiss> so i'd be adding +nethack to my use flags, and everythign that has the ability to be compiled with nethack would be recompiled
12:54 < DrItanium> Or you could specifically target screen
12:55 < swiss> yeah, but i don't use screen commands themselves enough to enjoy it. It'd be the surprise of getting a nethack like error message on a random program that'd be fun
12:55 < swiss> but I'm thinking it's not worth it at this point, so I'll just wait till I pick up the e6530
12:56 < DrItanium> Oh I wasn't talking about how useful they were. I was arguing the semantics of the statement, my point was that you could target screen specifically and not clutter up your use flags in /etc/make.conf
12:59 < swiss> oh, yeah, i guess
12:59 < swiss> could also do it with a mask
13:57 < hotdogs> wat
13:58 < hotdogs> pretty sure screen is the only user of the nethack flag
13:58 < hotdogs> gg context sensitive use flags
14:30 < zero-one> gradius: the fuck kind of dream is that
14:31 < zero-one> you know what freud would say
14:31 < zero-one> i think you want my cock
14:42 < swiss> choose a language for my IRC bot!
14:42 < swiss> one that I'd probably be able to do it in
14:43 < zero-one> swiss: C++
14:43 < zero-one> you have to do it for engineering anyway
14:43 < zero-one> er..
14:43 < zero-one> C
14:43 < zero-one> not C++
14:43 < swiss> oh man... i should
14:44 < swiss> the thing I hate most in programming might be having to define the type of variable something is :/
14:45 < zero-one> swiss: FUCK YOU
14:45 < zero-one> BLARRGHH
14:45 < swiss> I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying I hate doing it
14:45 < zero-one> yes
14:45 < zero-one> yes i know
14:45 < timmah> swiss: gb2 python
14:45 < swiss> I like my simple bash and stuff where I just type n=""
14:46 < swiss> timmah: i seem to remember defining thing in python as well
14:46  * swiss hasn't touched python for ~1 year now
14:46 < swiss> OH THAT'S RIGHt
14:46 < swiss> zero-one: I won a robot competition at boy scout camp kinda
14:46 < swiss> they gave us mindstorms on a prebuilt robot and gave us sample code to tweak
14:47 < swiss> i didn't like their code, so i wrote one from scratch, referencing theirs and samples builtin to get the syntax down
14:47 < swiss> and had a robot that destroyed the others
14:47 < swiss> sumo wrestling robots
14:47 < swiss> and that was in C-ish
14:49 < zero-one> swiss: do it in Prolog
14:49 < zero-one> DOOEET
14:50 < swiss> zero-one: this looks cool actually
14:51 < zero-one> lolol
14:51 < zero-one> if you write an irc bot in prolog, i will buy you dinner at the next bufla
14:51 < swiss> the hardest thing on most of these languages will be communication with the IRC server
14:51 < swiss> imo
14:52 < swiss> http://www.learnprolognow.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online
15:03 < swiss> emerging tuprolog now
15:11 < hotdogs> of course, there's irc bots in damn near every language on the internet these days
15:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: tribes + spinning kniggits tonight?
15:12 < hotdogs> NO
15:15 < swiss> zero-one: READ READ READ http://mind.sourceforge.net/aisteps.html
15:15 < swiss> zero-one: i think we should
15:34 < zero-one> swiss: oh god
15:34 < zero-one> no
15:34 < zero-one> definitely no
15:35 < swiss> zero-one: why not
15:35 < zero-one> 1. This would take a ridiculous amount of time
15:35 < zero-one> 2. I don't want to be killed in my sleep by a confused robot
15:35 < swiss> we will be living in close proximity most likely for the next year or two
15:35 < swiss> we have plenty of time
15:37 < zero-one> oh boy
15:38 < zero-one> if you can think of a good use for an AI for us, I might be interested
15:38 < hotdogs> sorting my laundry
15:38 < zero-one> swiss: also, remember that we don't exactly have many resources as far as machinery goes
15:39 < zero-one> so it'll have to be more of a... turn the lights off and on kind of AI
15:39 < swiss> zero-one: I assume as CompE I can get my hands on things
15:39 < zero-one> if you get what i mean
15:39 < swiss> zero-one: and I have mindstorms
15:39 < swiss> currently, my mindstorms bot reads and solves sudoku puzzles
15:39 < zero-one> ok, ok, so what could we have an AI do for us then
15:41 < swiss> sort laundry is one idea
15:41 < swiss> fold and put away clothes
15:42 < swiss> keep track of our food stock and tell us when we need more
15:42 < zero-one> swiss: that's not realistic
15:42 < hotdogs> masturbot
15:42 < swiss> zero-one: why not?
15:42 < hotdogs> MASTURBOT
15:42 < swiss> i don't see issues with it
15:42 < hotdogs> MASTURBOT
15:42 < hotdogs> MASTURBOT
15:42 < hotdogs> MASTURBOT
15:42 < hotdogs> MASTURBOT
15:42 < zero-one> how the hell are we going to have a robot sort laundry
15:42 < zero-one> you need large robotic arms
15:42 < zero-one> and shit like that
15:42 < hotdogs> if my mom can do it, a robot can
15:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: I....
15:43 < zero-one> I don't even want to know
15:43 < swiss> zero-one: so we get large robotic arms
15:43 < swiss> it's not that hard
15:43 < hotdogs> zero-one: sorting laundry?
15:43 < swiss> hotdogs: masturbot.. if mom can do it....
15:43 < hotdogs> I was talking about laundry, you fucking perverts
15:43 < zero-one> hotdogs: you made it sound like masturbot would replace your mom
15:43 < hotdogs> no, you were ignoring my masturbot idea
15:44 < zero-one> lolol
15:44 < hotdogs> because it's too realistic
15:44 < hotdogs> it will bring about world peace
15:44 < zero-one> swiss: i really do think that you're underestimating the difficulty of a task like this
15:44 < swiss> nah, it won't work for a good year
15:45 < swiss> but if the robot can read and solve sudoku puzzles, i think it can identify a shirt
15:45 < hotdogs> can it identify a sudoku puzzle at an angle?
15:46 < swiss> you have to start it off at a specific point on the puzzle format
15:47 < swiss> but it can read the numbers pretty accurately
15:47 < swiss> all the robot has to do to identify the shirt then is rotate the image a few times or something
15:47 < hotdogs> lol
15:47 < swiss> or, if it's sorting before it goes in it has some sort of feel sensor (or light sensor) to determine the sort of fabric it is, and the color
15:48 < zero-one> swiss: we should just go for a robot that FOLDS our clothing
15:48 < swiss> zero-one: that'd be harder
15:48 < zero-one> THAT is a worthy endeavor
15:48 < zero-one> swiss: yes
15:48 < zero-one> it is much harder
15:48 < zero-one> and it won't work for a long fucking time
15:49 < zero-one> but when it does, it'll be glorious
15:49 < zero-one> and we'll never have to fold laundry again
15:50 < swiss> zero-one: figure out how to take a shirt (in any condition) and get it in a recognizable shape with the same movements and I'm in
15:50 < zero-one> not with the same movements
15:50 < zero-one> different starting shape might require different moves
15:51 < zero-one> important thing, i think, is identifying the corners
15:51 < swiss> it needs to get it into enough of a shape it'd be recognized as a shirt
15:51 < swiss> so how would it grab a random 2 points and shake out the shirt (which could be balled up) to make it say "yes, this is a shirt"
15:51 < hotdogs> and we shall call it ShirtDestroyer
15:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: fucking lol
15:52 < hotdogs> it grabs two points on the human and shakes them
15:52 < zero-one> swiss: i'm not sure what algorithm we could use for that
15:52 < zero-one> this will require much pondering
15:52 < zero-one> haha
15:52 < swiss> zero-one: i'd imagine we'd need the hands to have freely rotating balls at the end, and then move outwards while clamping enough that it won't go over a seam, but enough force it won't drop the shirt
15:59 < swiss> methinks MS crashed again
15:59 < swiss> err wrong chan
16:02 < drboots> So Bill Gates wants to build a better shitter
16:04 < prometheusx> it's simple, use 3 seashells
16:24 < hotdogs> should I tell catears to join #testgradius so she doesn't get banned from #swift
16:24 < prometheusx> pfft
16:25 < prometheusx> why would they ban her? there are several people who join and leave that aren't banned
16:25 < hotdogs> dunno
16:26 < prometheusx> I'm a cat and I'll kick your butt.
16:26 < prometheusx> i read that as lick your butt at first
16:26 < hotdogs> I think ttam was mad that she used kitty at first
16:26 < hotdogs> even though kitchen is AFK forever
16:27 < prometheusx> only 28 hours in skyrim, casual
16:28 < hotdogs> Yes
16:28 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah, bring her in here so we can harass her without fear of her getting banned
16:29 < swiss> hotdogs: i don't care
16:31 < prometheusx> pfft, its like she just blew through skyrim doing the main story
16:58 < hotdogs> what a loser
17:40 < drboots> I forgot how much time I have on Skyrim, but its a lot more than 28 hours
17:40 < drboots> and Im only about halfway through the story
18:16 < gradius> hotdogs: you can tell her
18:17 < gradius> since this room is more receptive to WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT TO DO
18:17 < gradius> FUCKING NAZI SWIFT MODS

18:34 < gradius> alexjandro: yeah that timing fucking sucked
18:35 < zero-one> gradius: hotdogs: we should forget about LoL and go to NSL instead
18:35 < gradius> but I didnt wanna waste time in traffic that I could be using for studying
18:35 < hotdogs> gradius: studying for your shit class?
18:35 < alexjandro> took me 2.5 hours to get there :/
18:35 < timmah> gradius: D's get degrees
18:35 < alexjandro> oh well
18:35 < gradius> hotdogs: mostly just doing previous midterms
18:35 < hotdogs> timmah: but they don't
18:35 < gradius> so I can copy paste.
18:35 < hotdogs> you need a 2.0 bro
18:36 < gradius> so I dont spend 4hrs in class
18:36 < timmah> FLUBBER SNUBBER

18:36 < gradius> CUNTS
18:36 < gradius> WOOT
18:36 < hotdogs> Dresona: do universities in australia still use the primitive caveman A-F grading scale
18:37 < hotdogs> I'm really hoping someone somewhere is doing something not-stupid
18:37 < Dresona> no
18:37 < hotdogs> is it out of 100
18:37 < Dresona> we use F, P, C, D, HD
18:37 < hotdogs> WHAT
18:37 < hotdogs> HIGH DEFINITION IS A GRADE?
18:38 < Dresona> fail, pass, credit distinction, high distinction
18:38 < zero-one> hotdogs: they use ƃ ɟ ǝ p ɔ q ɐ
18:38 < Dresona> ..
18:38 < Dresona> :P
18:38 < hotdogs> so I assume you're HD all the way
18:38 < hotdogs> all the time
18:39 < timmah> hotdogs: yeah, don't want the jaggies to cut you
18:39 < hotdogs> unless you're just a plain 1080P
18:39 < hotdogs> wait wat
18:39 < Dresona> no :(
18:39 < Dresona> well, kinda, except for maths
18:39 < gradius> Dresona: fuck math
18:39 < gradius> :)
18:39 < Dresona> :D
18:39 < hotdogs> :(
18:39 < gradius> hotdogs: I KNOW IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE, IM A BAD CS MAJOR
18:39 < gradius> :(
18:40 < hotdogs> so is Dresona apparently!!!
18:40 < Dresona> NUH UH
18:40 < swiss> I'm not only HD, I'm retina display quality!
18:40 < hotdogs> WHAT'S WRONG WITH MATHS
18:40 < timmah> swiss: come back when you're Hi444PP
18:41 < swiss> timmah: i'll never be that color coordinated, I'm an ECE major
18:41 < timmah> dear god no.
18:41 < timmah> please don't design anything that uses electricity
18:41 < timmah> I don't want to die :(
18:41 < gradius> 12 amps, 120 amps
18:42 < gradius> whats the difference
18:42 < hotdogs> don't worry, he won't find a job after graduating
18:42 < swiss> i haven't made anything go boom yet.... ok that's a lie
18:42 < gradius> amps == volts right?
18:42 < swiss> but I haven't cause any LARGE electrical fires
18:42 < hotdogs> gradius: more like wats
18:42 < hotdogs> amps * volts = wat
18:42 < Dresona> the sheep is in my bed
18:42 < gradius> Dresona: dat sheep.
18:42 < Dresona> and i'm wearing the kitty ears today
18:42 < gradius> I was like
18:42 < gradius> why is she
18:42 < gradius> putting the sheep on my face
18:43 < Dresona> :D
18:43 < gradius> I just met her.
18:43 < Dresona> SHEEPFACE
18:43 < gradius> hahaha
18:43 < hotdogs> note: that was sheep #1
18:43 < hotdogs> RIP sheep #1
18:43 < Dresona> that one died
18:43 < Dresona> :(
18:43 < hotdogs> for science!
18:43 < zero-one> gradius: the difference between 12 and 120 amps is how many times over they'll kill you
18:44 < gradius> meh
18:44 < gradius> i aint afraid of no little shock
18:44 < timmah> WHO YOU GONNA CALL
18:44 < hotdogs> the difference is how fuckin' rockin your guitar sounds
18:44 < hotdogs> I ONLY PLAY ON 120 AMPS
18:45 < zero-one> hotdogs: you mean 120 watt amps?
18:46 < hotdogs> no 120 amps
18:46 < gradius> zero-one: .... damn it hotdogs
18:46 < gradius> i was going to say that.
18:46 < zero-one> hahahaha

18:53  * hotdogs googles java jokes
18:54 < hotdogs> just like java, all these jokes are bad
18:54 < Dresona> Two ints and a float are in a bar. They spot an attractive double on her own.   The first int walks up to her. “Hey, baby”, he says, “my VM or yours”. She slaps him and he walks back dejected.  The second int walks over. “Hey, cute-stuff, can I lick your Bean?”. After a quick slapping, he too walks back.  The float then ambles over casually. “Were those two primitive types bothering you?”, he remarks.  “Yes. I’m so glad yo
18:54 < Dresona> that's so bad
18:54 < Dresona> SO BAD
18:54 < zero-one> hotdogs: "YOU LUV LUV LUV LUV" make me think of this immediately: http://youtu.be/T4aY8PMaEqw

18:55 < gradius> IM NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT THOUGHT THAT
18:55 < gradius> hahahah
18:55 < zero-one> HAHAHA
18:55 < zero-one> oh wow
18:55 < gradius> I wasn't going to say anything because I thought it wouldn't make sense to anyone
18:55 < hotdogs> zero-one: neat
18:55 < alexjandro> Dresona: that double is a cunt
18:56 < alexjandro> Dresona: so did you swim with sharks?
18:56 < timmah> Dresona: YOU DIDN'T FINISH THE JOKE
18:56 < Dresona> i am in a few days alexjandro
18:56 < Dresona> timmah: s!
18:56 < alexjandro> Do they have shark week over there?
18:56 < Dresona> there.
18:56 < Dresona> no
18:56 < alexjandro> is it every week?
18:57 < Dresona> yes
18:57 < hotdogs> does the discovery channel have a dropbear week
18:58 < hotdogs> Dresona: please don't die to sharks
18:58 < alexjandro> Dresona: when you were in Vegas, did you go to In-N-Out?
18:58 < Dresona> okay i'll try
18:59 < Dresona> no, but I did go last time I went to the USA :P
18:59 < alexjandro> oh
18:59 < alexjandro> okay
18:59 < Dresona> oh

19:00 < gradius> I want food
19:00 < gradius> :(
19:00 < hotdogs> is that an extra happy ending?
19:00 < gradius> FEED ME
19:01 < hotdogs> WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS IN PARALLEL
19:01 < hotdogs> IT'S TAKING FOREVER
19:01 < alexjandro> gradius: would i have gotten BJs too?
19:01 < zero-one> hotdogs: gradius: where are we going for bufla tomorrow?
19:01 < alexjandro> BJs
19:01 < zero-one> I say we get davie to make us pasta
19:01 < hotdogs> I don't want to drive to pasadena
19:01 < gradius> alexjandro: seamless if for people that stay in the office past 7 :(

19:03 < hotdogs> plz
19:03 < hotdogs> oh wait, why don't I just sniff your traffic
19:03 < gradius> only if I get to ban your accoutn personally
19:03 < Dresona> wait, what
19:03 < gradius> hotdogs: DONT ABUSE YOUR POWER
19:03 < Dresona> shark week is actually a thing?!
19:03 < gradius> OR ILL ABUSE MINE
19:04 < gradius> FUCK
19:04 < zero-one> Dresona: yes, lol

19:10 < hotdogs> back to the boring usual stuff
19:13 < alexjandro> hotdogs: hi
19:14 < alexjandro> noo i was gonna ask how seasons work over there
19:15 < hotdogs> they're inverted
19:16 < zero-one> hotdogs: are you still at work
19:16 < hotdogs> also, sydney is like near the same latitude but negative as us
19:16 < hotdogs> yeah, this shit is taking forever to finish
19:17 < hotdogs> you guys could play one
19:17 < alexjandro> what are you doing at work?
19:17 < alexjandro> was that a cisco config you were saving
19:19 < hotdogs> copying to running-config from tftp
19:20 < alexjandro> oh
19:23 < hotdogs> resetting banners
19:23 < hotdogs> it's difficult to script
19:24 < alexjandro> ohh no! :(
19:28 < hotdogs> eh?
19:28 < hotdogs> all the prompt stuff messes up automation tools
19:28 < hotdogs> because they expect the regular prompt to appear again
19:29 < hotdogs> I seem to remember copypasta'ing configs messing up prompts too
19:34 < alexjandro> ive never had an issue copy/pasteing banners
20:08 < hotdogs> with a bunch of other commands?
20:08 < hotdogs> also, would you like to reset the banner on 400 switches for me
20:09 < prometheusx> i missed all the fun
20:09 < zero-one> hotdogs: we're playing a quick game now
20:22 < alexjandro> hotdogs: pay me $10/switch
20:25 < hotdogs> and you call yourself mexican
20:25 < alexjandro> thats a fair price
20:25 < alexjandro> how much are they paying you?
20:26 < hotdogs> not enough to pay you
20:26 < alexjandro> lolol
20:26 < hotdogs> also, given how many you could do in an hour, not that much
20:26 < alexjandro> we can work out...other payment plans ;)
20:59 < swiss> fucking lolling at this spam http://speedcap.net/img/f7e050c7d614ef0dcafff48deecb214c/c1d472c3.png
21:19 < drboots> lol
21:20 < drboots> Its like those ads that say standard browser games are adult games
22:05 < swiss> zero-one: so the query based structure of prolog will work for the database of anime pretty nicely actually
22:05 < swiss> I can have stuff like 'is1080p'
22:06 < zero-one> swiss: you could just as well keep a relational database
22:07 < swiss> zero-one: yeah, but prolog is smart as well
22:07 < zero-one> explain
22:07 < swiss> I don't have to set each relation. I could say is1080p and then have another thing that says isBluray :- is1080p
22:08 < swiss> and someone could query "isBluRay(series name)"
22:08 < swiss> but I never set that it was blu ray specifically I just set something up earlier that said "everything that is1080p automatically isBluray as well)
22:09 < swiss> and because 720p can be from TV or BD in Japan (BD from earlier anime) I could put isBluray I'd have to put isBluray on those specifically
22:10 < swiss> and that's like the most basic part of prolog
22:10 < swiss> it does a ton of other stuff that I haven't even figured out yet
22:10 < swiss> I worked iwth it for maybe 20 minutes today
22:10 < zero-one> I don't get it, wouldn't you have to put isBluray on those BECAUSE there are some 720p movies that come from bluray discs?
22:11 < swiss> but all 1080p videos would AUTOMATICALLY be isBluray
22:11 < swiss> becuase of one line in the knowledge database
22:11 < zero-one> yes, but then for our purposes, what is the point of a movie being identified as having come from a bluray disc?
22:12 < swiss> for my IRC bot that is for searching for videos on swissbox?
22:12 < swiss> the other thing I sent you wasn't for prolog. It was for general AI programming
22:14 < zero-one> i understand that much
22:14 < zero-one> what i'm asking is, why does anyone care if the movie came from a bluray disc
22:14 < zero-one> specifying the resolution isn't good enough?
22:15 < DrItanium> Don't use prolog to keep things in a "database". It's a logical programming language
22:15 < zero-one> DrItanium: that's EXACTLY what i'm trying to get across
22:15 < swiss> zero-one: yes, because the bluray will be the highest quality availible
22:16 < zero-one> swiss: how?
22:16 < swiss> zero-one: for anime?
22:16 < zero-one> for anything
22:16 < DrItanium> swiss: Bluray isn't hte highest quality possible even for anime. There is such thing as 1440p and cinema 4k
22:16 < swiss> DrItanium: it's the highest availible in almost every case
22:16 < swiss> DrItanium: zero-one wants me to write my IRC bot in prolog, so I am figuring out how to do it
22:17 < swiss> it's 100% the wrong language to do it in, but it'll be interesting
22:17 < DrItanium> Also bluray is a media storage specification with a video specification as well
22:17 < DrItanium> swiss: Enjoy pulling your hair out with the warren virtual machine
22:17 < zero-one> swiss: actually, i think prolog might work somewhat nicely as a bot
22:17 < swiss> huh?
22:17 < DrItanium> zero-one: Not really
22:17 < swiss> zero-one: for a bot? yes. For the bot I'm writing? no
22:17 < zero-one> DrItanium: what about NLP
22:18 < DrItanium> While it will work due to turing equivalence it will be a fucking pain in the ass
22:18 < swiss> DrItanium: something like cleverbot for IRC? i'd imagine prolog would be a good thing to do it in.
22:18 < DrItanium> swiss: You're wanting an inference engine
22:18  * swiss is totally speaking out of his ass though
22:18 < swiss> I just understand prolog was made to write AIs and things like that
22:19 < DrItanium> AIs? Nope, that's more in the realm of LISP
22:19 < swiss> "Prolog is a general purpose logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics.[1][2][3]"
22:19 < swiss> from wikipedia
22:19 < DrItanium> I said it was more in the realm of LISP
22:19 < swiss> lisp would probably work better
22:20 < DrItanium> Plus AI does not equate to the AI durandal, leela, or tycho from marathon
22:20 < zero-one> hahaha
22:20 < DrItanium> AI refers to using heuristics to solve difficult problems
22:20 < DrItanium> And other techniques
22:22  * DrItanium shudders at writing an IRC bot in prolog
22:23 < DrItanium> swiss: I just wrote an expert system to perform wavefront scheduling. That consisted of 310 rules including the knowledge construction engine to get LLVM structures into CLIPS
22:23 < DrItanium> Well I didn't just write it
22:24 < airen> DrItanium: Did you see that GCC is moving towards C++ much like LLVM?
22:25 < DrItanium> what do you mean?
22:25 < DrItanium> Oh! shit
22:25 < DrItanium> Wow, fucking about time
22:28 < DrItanium> Is that for gcc 5?
22:29 < swiss> half tempted to switch to LISP for this though
22:33 < zero-one> DrItanium: what makes LISP more suited for AI work?
22:34 < DrItanium> It's really easy to represent things
22:34 < DrItanium> You can create data structures easy because everything is a list
22:34 < DrItanium> *easily
22:40 < airen> Not to mention s-expressions.
22:41 < DrItanium> That too!
22:41 < DrItanium> And garbage collection
22:42 < airen> And macros
22:42 < airen> Delicious macros
22:42 < DrItanium> mmmmmmmm :)
22:44 < hotdogs> macroni and cheese
22:44 < DrItanium> lol
23:23 < zero-one> anyone here ever tried bridging a VM through the host's wireless interface?
23:23 < alexjandro> umm
23:23 < alexjandro> i think there are issues with that
23:24 < zero-one> alexjandro: from what i've read, that has to do with the fact that the vm doesn't authenticate with the AP
23:24 < zero-one> which you can avoid if you spoof the source MAC of the traffic coming from the VM
23:25 < zero-one> but I can't think of why that wouldn't work
23:25 < zero-one> because from reading, it seems like that's not as straightforward as i think it is
23:44 < hotdogs> zero-one: it's not going to work
23:44 < hotdogs> you can't bridge to wireless.
23:44 < hotdogs> No.
23:44 < hotdogs> Bad.
23:44 < hotdogs> Impossible.
23:46 < alexjandro> HTat ^
23:46 < alexjandro> That^*
23:48 < hotdogs> zero-one: wireless isn't real ethernet
23:49 < hotdogs> and you can't have your host and the VM use the same MAC because then you can't distinguish traffic
23:49 < hotdogs> also, as far as I know wireless hardware doesn't do two macs
23:49 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm sure there are ways to tag packets
23:50 < zero-one> so that having one mac isn't a problem
23:50 < hotdogs> wat
23:51 < alexjandro> zero-one: stop talking
23:51 < alexjandro> May have tried before
23:51 < alexjandro> Many*
23:51 < hotdogs> you could encapsulate it, but then you'd be making a wireless bridge
23:52 < hotdogs> at which point you're not a regular wireless client
23:52 < zero-one> nevermind what i said about tagging
23:53 < zero-one> that works on the way out, not the way in :(
23:53 < hotdogs> you would have an interesting time having your host and vm communicate
23:53 < hotdogs> using the same mac
23:54 < zero-one> nono
23:54 < hotdogs> or do you mean mangling the packets
23:54 < zero-one> yes
23:54 < zero-one> mangling
23:54 < hotdogs> suddenly you're NAT'ing at layer 2
23:55 < hotdogs> DAT'ing
23:55 < alexjandro> wat
23:55 < hotdogs> data-link address translation
23:57 < alexjandro> my head hurts

14:17 < alexjandro> fucker
14:17 < alexjandro> zero-one: HEY FUCK YOU FOR LEAVING TRASH IN MY CAR
14:17 < zero-one> wat
14:17 < prometheusx> i could too, it's on the way for me
14:18 < alexjandro> zero-one: the bottle of water you bought at the gas station before we went up the mountian
14:19 < zero-one> alexjandro: ah! yeah, that's because i sat in the front on the way down
14:19 < zero-one> totally forgot that thing existed
14:19 < hotdogs> what an asshole
14:19 < zero-one> alexjandro: when do you leave work today?
14:20 < zero-one> so we can CCDC together in the lab
14:20 < alexjandro> zero-one: I never went...
14:20 < hotdogs> zero-one: ARE YOU IN THE LAB?
14:20 < alexjandro> I was gonna use that for an excuse to go to lunch but then i ate at home
14:20 < zero-one> hotdogs: nope, i'm at home
14:20 < hotdogs> oh
14:20 < hotdogs> did you go to work?
14:20 < zero-one> no
14:20 < hotdogs> lololo
14:21 < zero-one> I'm going to go friday, so I can make backups
14:21 < zero-one> now that I think about it, giving them some kind of notice might have been a good idea
14:22 < zero-one> but they give me 6 hours a week
14:22 < zero-one> so it's not like it really matters THAT much
14:22 < zero-one> if they needed me that bad, I'd have much more than 6 hours
14:26 < zero-one> alexjandro: I have some stuff to take care of here, but I can head over to the lab in an hour or so
14:26 < zero-one> sound good?
14:26 < alexjandro> nope
14:27 < alexjandro> ill pick you up for bufla
14:27 < zero-one> and then we'll hit the lab afterwards?
14:27 < prometheusx> hotdogs: CORN RACE GO!
14:27 < prometheusx> timmah: ^
14:27 < timmah> I'M WAITING MAN
14:28 < alexjandro> maybe
14:34 < prometheusx> hotdogs: go bufla!

14:39 < airen> lol
15:17 < alexjandro> zero-one: are you gonna be in the lab or home?
15:19 < hotdogs> I don't think anyone is at the lab currently
15:20 < alexjandro> how do you know?
15:23 < prometheusx> he's in the lab banging chicks
15:25 < hotdogs> I saw chrislz leave the lab 45 min ago
15:25 < hotdogs> then I texted him and he didn't respond
15:27 < hotdogs> like a jerk
15:31 < timmah> need water?
15:33 < hotdogs> not at all
15:33 < hotdogs> do you wanna walk?
15:34 < timmah> yes
15:34 < timmah> wanna stop by bldg 9
15:37 < zero-one> alexjandro: i'll be at home
15:37 < zero-one> unless you want to meet in the lab beforehand
15:37 < hotdogs> gonna buy more ice cream?
15:38 < prometheusx> timmah: what ice cream did you get?
15:38 < hotdogs> buttrape blueberry
15:39 < prometheusx> i'd expect it to be brown and red, not blue
15:39 < hotdogs> surprise!

19:36 < drboots> I know it is
19:38 < swiss> thought you were asking if they had an arcuid one
19:40 < drboots> I meant "have a thing for" as "have a fancy for" more like, but I suppose I hve to articulate a bit better for you :P
19:42 < hotdogs> gradius: gradius
19:42 < swiss> oh, it's the only character chrislz can identify
19:42 < drboots> gradius: gradius
19:50 < zero-one> gradius: gradius

20:12 < swiss> wtf is up with this hdd
20:12 < swiss> [525698.307786] sd 13:0:0:0: [sdd] CDB: cdb[0]=0x2a: 2a 00 10 00 0d 00 00 04 00 00

20:13 < zero-one> uh oh
20:13 < zero-one> lol
20:13 < swiss> i think it's dead
20:13 < swiss> but i have no idea what those errors mea
20:14 < hotdogs> check smart bro
20:14 < hotdogs> smartctl --all /dev/sdd
20:18 < swiss> hotdogs:
20:18 < swiss> Device does not support SMART
20:18 < swiss> Request Sense failed, [Input/output error]
20:18 < swiss> Error Counter logging not supported
20:18 < swiss> Device does not support Self Test logging
20:18 < hotdogs> lololo
20:19 < hotdogs> so it blows up if you even smartctl -i /dev/sdd?
20:19 < hotdogs> sounds like your drive is dead
20:19 < zero-one> hotdogs: what happens if i remove the default runlevel from inittab?
20:20 < hotdogs> remove?
20:21 < zero-one> yup
20:21 < zero-one> comment out completely
20:22 < hotdogs> did you read the inittab man page
20:22  * zero-one pulls it up
20:23 < zero-one> oh
20:23 < zero-one> so it'll prompt you?
20:23 < hotdogs> I guess so
20:23 < hotdogs> I've never done it
20:24 < zero-one> *black team idea*
20:24 < hotdogs> meh
20:24 < hotdogs> can't now
20:24 < swiss> zero-one: that's pussyshit
20:25 < swiss> just have to define the runlevel during grub boot to fuck that up
20:25 < swiss> now you should make it single user mode or something in grub in case they reboot, that'd be funny :p
20:26 < zero-one> how does GRUB change the default runlevel?
20:31 < swiss> in the command that includes the initrd i think
20:31 < swiss> http://www.centos.org/docs/4/html/rhel-rg-en-4/s1-grub-runlevels.html
20:31 < swiss> the kernel command
20:32 < swiss> I did it when chrislz fucked up the moebuntu computer, remember?
20:32 < swiss> you might have been too busy on that arch then
20:32 < swiss> but it wouldn't boot because of plymouth, so i changed it to single user mode on boot to be able to reinstlal
20:33 < swiss> !space hdd2
20:33 < swissboxbot> On /home/sftp/mount/hdd2 there is 14G availible of 150G. 92% of this drive is full.
20:33 < swiss> lololol
20:42 < swiss> zero-one: I REQUIRE MORE HARD DRIVES
20:43 < swiss> maybe I'll buy a 2 or 3 TB one with my birthday cash
20:46 < zero-one> swiss: HDD's are getting cheap
20:46 < zero-one> check newegg for sales
20:47 < swiss> zero-one: still $150
20:47 < swiss> wtf is http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16840999258
20:49 < swiss> zero-one: it's like... a hard drive of magnetic tape
20:50 < zero-one> you mean like...
20:50 < zero-one> like a TAPE DRIVE
20:50 < swiss> would this be a bad idea for anime
20:51 < zero-one> swiss: depends
20:51 < swiss> well ,the issue I see is I have to read all the data in order
20:51 < swiss> no needle like a hard drive
20:52 < zero-one> >needle
20:52 < zero-one> i lol'd
20:52 < zero-one> but yeah, you're right
20:52 < zero-one> access times will not be good
20:52 < zero-one> lol
20:52 < swiss> So how would i fix that? I'd imagine if I had it cache with a SSD
20:53 < swiss> then it'd work
20:53 < swiss> like I slap one in, it reads it and caches it on a SSD
20:53 < zero-one> swiss: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822136874
20:53 < zero-one> free RAID card
20:54 < swiss> i'd need 2 high volume hdds to make raid worthwhile
21:03 < swiss> decided to forget about tape. Talked to my dad about it, and apparently after 4 years you need to throw out tapes
21:03 < swiss> cause they just go bad
21:04 < swiss> will wait to see a 3TB <$120
21:04 < swiss> then grab that
21:24 < hotdogs> TAPE = BAD
21:26 < swiss> ordered an HDD
21:26 < swiss> http://www.buy.com/prod/q/loc/101/220509010.html
21:35 < hotdogs> buy.com, most reputable
21:39 < swiss> hotdogs: meh, it appeared on slickdeals
21:39 < swiss> also, look at price.
21:39 < swiss> then look waht drive that's storing internally
21:39 < swiss> I'm cracking it the moment it gets here
21:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: gradius: LoL time?
21:59 < zero-one> hotdogs: how about a game?
22:01 < hotdogs> already playin somethin
22:04 < prometheusx> the skin flute
22:09 < hotdogs> nah catears isn't on webcam
22:17 < prometheusx> it's kind of hard for her to get naked during class
22:58 < alexjandro> zero-one: I'll play the game on Satuday before/after CCDC
22:59 < alexjandro> probably before
22:59 < alexjandro> haha
23:02 < zero-one> alexjandro: i'll play it with you
23:02 < zero-one> but we should probably save it for nighttime
23:04 < alexjandro> NO
23:04 < alexjandro> BEFORE ccdc
23:04 < alexjandro> and thats it
23:04 < zero-one> AWWWW
23:04 < zero-one> COME ONE

12:05 < swiss> hmmm
12:06 < swiss> onlive official twitter looks like they're going strong
12:06 < alexjandro> Yea, if I was that guy and everyone just got fired, i'd go crazy with the twitter
12:08 < swiss> "A new company will be formed and the management of the company will be in contact with you about the current initiatives in place"
12:09 < hotdogs> zero-one: do you want to do lunch at like 1
12:09 < hotdogs> prometheusx: is apparently hungry as well
12:09 < zero-one> hotdogs: sure, i can do that
12:13 < hotdogs> OH WAIT, JUSTIN ASKED ME ABOUT FOOD BUT HE'S NOWHERE NEAR HERE
12:13 < alexjandro> Where is he? LA
12:14 < hotdogs> shittown usa
12:14 < zero-one> hotdogs: so is that a no again?
12:14 < hotdogs> I dunno
12:14 < hotdogs> I guess I'll go
12:14 < alexjandro> hotdogs: COME TO RANCHO
12:14 < hotdogs> I need to get groceries
12:14 < hotdogs> so I can do that after lunch
12:15 < zero-one> MAKE UP YOUR MINDS PEOPLE
12:15 < hotdogs> wat
12:15 < gradius> SHEEPLE
12:15 < zero-one> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
12:15 < zero-one> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
12:15 < zero-one> WAKE UP SHEEPLE
12:15 < hotdogs> gradius: u hungry

12:22 < hotdogs> https://twitter.com/BrianFargo/status/236542374761861120
12:22 < hotdogs> kik
12:22 < hotdogs> lol
12:33 < swiss> BUYVM HAS STOCK
12:34 < swiss> fuck, do i wnat another?
12:35 < alexjandro> yes
12:35 < swiss> but what will i do with it
12:35 < swiss> I could put the security blog back up
12:35 < swiss> hrmmmmmm
12:36 < swiss> gradius: Can wordpress run on 128?
12:36 < zero-one> alexjandro: turns out that second gateway was a fallback
12:37 < alexjandro> makes sense
12:37 < zero-one> swiss: i'm really tempted to upgrade to a 512 with 2 cores
12:38 < swiss> zero-one: hmm, now that's an idea
12:38 < swiss> then $6 a month
12:38 < swiss> but that could be enough to wordpress
12:38 < zero-one> it's $4 a month
12:38 < swiss> OH you're looking at burstable
12:38 < swiss> I'm looking at base ram
12:38 < zero-one> yeah
12:39 < swiss> I want to run a wordpress site
12:39 < hotdogs> I bet you could tune down wordpress to run in 128
12:39 < swiss> but no way in hell will i pay $35 a year to just host a wordpress
12:39 < zero-one> double the amount of memory i have now should be enough
12:39 < swiss> hotdogs: nope
12:39 < hotdogs> nope?
12:39 < swiss> i checked
12:40 < hotdogs> what did you check
12:40 < zero-one> swiss: i don't understand why you can't run a wordpress under 100mb
12:40 < zero-one> I CAN
12:40 < swiss> if you could get wordpress down to 128
12:40 < swiss> zero-one: with traffic? and a good database?
12:40 < hotdogs> how did you check
12:40 < swiss> hotdogs: asking :P
12:40 < hotdogs> asking who
12:40 < swiss> people!
12:40 < zero-one> oh
12:40 < hotdogs> fuckface, stop making me pull fucking teeth
12:40 < zero-one> shut
12:40 < swiss> and the internet
12:40 < zero-one> *shit
12:40 < zero-one> that's right, i need an sql server, don't i
12:40 < swiss> yep
12:40 < zero-one> nevermind :(
12:41 < zero-one> I can't use sqlite or something?
12:41 < swiss> hotdogs: get sql + php + nginx (lightest i can think of that might run wordpress) < 128 MB?
12:41 < swiss> zero-one: even with sqlit
12:41 < zero-one> oh darn
12:41 < hotdogs> mysql is the real problem
12:42 < zero-one> yeah
12:42 < hotdogs> running nginx/php separately is a bad idea
12:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: wat
12:42 < hotdogs> you'd likely get lower usage out of just apache using one process
12:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: idk about that
12:42 < hotdogs> are you running nginx?
12:42 < zero-one> yup
12:43 < hotdogs> how big is its process?
12:44 < swiss> a couple people claim they can do it with a script from lowendbox
12:44 < hotdogs> copypasta its line from top
12:44 < swiss> zero-one: wanna try it for me? see if you can get it down to 128?
12:45 < swiss> zero-one: http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/wordpress-cheap-vps-lowendscript/
12:46 < swiss> then again, if they *really* can make it work at 60 MB i could just host it off my current box
12:47 < zero-one> hotdogs: Master process reserved 5016kB, and worker process 5660kB
12:48 < zero-one> and i'm not sure it's even using that much
12:48 < hotdogs> what's VIRT/RES
12:48 < zero-one> hotdogs: wat1952 root      18   0  5016  804  328 S   0.0  0.3   0:00.00 nginx                                                                                                       1953 www-data  15   0  5660 1904  876 S   0.0  0.7   0:00.39 nginx
12:49 < hotdogs> also, does buyvm slam you for overcommitting or just actual usage
12:49 < zero-one> what do you mean?
12:50 < hotdogs> do they care about VIRT or RES
12:51 < swiss> zero-one: better idea
12:51 < swiss> $1 a month from MySql
12:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: i don't understand. why would they?
12:51 < swiss> err
12:51 < swiss> BuyVM
12:51 < swiss> you get offload SQL
12:51 < swiss> zero-one: http://speedcap.net/img/f7e050c7d614ef0dcafff48deecb214c/1fe71b76.png
12:52 < zero-one> hotdogs: this virtual machine has a certain amount of memory allocated to it. If i try to use more, i get "failed to fork". what the fuck are you talking about
12:52 < swiss> do they slam you for staying over 128 MB?
12:53 < zero-one> not that i know
12:53 < zero-one> i haven't been charged by them or anything
12:56 < hotdogs> they eventually kill processes
12:56 < hotdogs> if you're burstin'
12:56 < zero-one> oh
12:56 < zero-one> i did not know this
12:57 < hotdogs> UNLIMITED DATABASES!!!
12:57 < hotdogs> at least, that's what I thought
12:57 < zero-one> hotdogs: 13:00
12:57 < zero-one> launch time
12:58 < hotdogs> cat /proc/user_beancounters
12:58 < hotdogs> neato
12:58 < hotdogs> zero-one: I still have to put on pants
12:59 < zero-one> hotdogs: wait
12:59 < zero-one> you're not at work?
12:59 < zero-one> OH
12:59 < zero-one> RIGHT
13:00 < zero-one> DAT FRIDAY SCHEDULE
13:00 < zero-one> IT DOESN'T EXIST
13:00 < zero-one> your reluctance towards lunching now makes so much more sense
13:01 < zero-one> don't put on pants on account of me, good sir
13:01 < hotdogs> I was waiting for you to figure it out
13:02 < zero-one> hotdogs: save your pants for shmimprov tonight
13:03 < zero-one> mwahahahaha
13:03 < hotdogs> it sounds like, within openvz, your shit will only get oom-killed out of burst ram if the host system is shitting bricks
13:03 < hotdogs> or you're in the "low" memory zone
13:03 < zero-one> so basically... i'm lucky
13:03 < hotdogs> oh, not what I thought
13:04 < hotdogs> so I think we can overcommit across 128mb fine
13:04 < hotdogs> though letting RES cross it is slightly crazier
13:04 < hotdogs> it's too bad /proc/meminfo is gutted
13:04 < hotdogs> I don't feel like calculating these things myself
13:05 < alexjandro> http://clientsfromhell.net/post/29630525507/a-client-was-planning-to-bring-over-a-video-for-me
13:07 < hotdogs> http://www.lowendbox.com/blog/why-i-dont-like-openvz-vps-plans-with-large-burstable-memory/
13:07 < hotdogs> feel free to use 256 on your 128, unless buyvm has extra magic
13:07 < hotdogs> time to put minecraft back on!
13:09 < hotdogs> zero-one: where are we meeting
13:11 < zero-one> hotdogs: leg of the CLA?
13:12 < hotdogs> I can go to the front gate
13:12 < hotdogs> no reason to go to the CLA unless you're there
13:13 < zero-one> front gate?
13:13 < zero-one> there are no gates here
13:14 < hotdogs> the gate in the triangle by the old stables
13:14 < hotdogs> I don't know where "here" is
13:14 < zero-one> at the moment, here is the credit union

16:28 < zero-one> because I need to throw some money their way
16:28 < alexjandro> gaten or wedgie or someone
16:28 < alexjandro> go ahead
16:28 < zero-one> 27M free?
16:28 < zero-one> UNACCEPTABLE
16:28 < alexjandro> THAT IS WHY YOUR NETHACK DIED
16:29 < zero-one> alexjandro: my nethack died needlessly
16:29 < alexjandro> where are you seeing 27M free?
16:29 < zero-one> free -m
16:29 < alexjandro> i got 46M
16:29 < zero-one> yeah, now it is
16:29 < alexjandro> oh
16:30 < zero-one> it's jumping back and forth
16:30 < zero-one> you know who doesn't need their session? alexjandro.
16:30 < zero-one> MWAHAHAHAHA
16:31 < alexjandro> noooooo
16:31 < alexjandro> cps should be for paying members, and whoever pays the bill
16:31 < zero-one> agreed
16:31 < alexjandro> ask airen, i think the one that is butthurt about that
16:32 < zero-one> we should just make membership cost a dollar more.
16:32 < zero-one> that'd pay for server cost
16:32 < alexjandro> How much does the linode cost?
16:32 < zero-one> alexjandro: trying to figure that out now
16:32 < alexjandro> ask gaten
16:33 < alexjandro> or wedgie
16:33 < alexjandro> i forgot who it is
16:33 < zero-one> 16:32 < zero-one> alexjandro: trying to figure that out now
16:33 < alexjandro> zero-one: You should try asking gaten or wedgie
16:33 < zero-one> 16:32 < zero-one> alexjandro: trying to figure that out now
16:33 < zero-one> 16:32 < zero-one> alexjandro: trying to figure that out now

16:34 < alexjandro> zero-one: check your csu email
16:34 < alexjandro> i don't think $1 more will cover that
16:34 < alexjandro> Unless we get a lot more members
16:36 < alexjandro> gradius: ? http://i.imgur.com/pD2x9.jpg
16:37 < swiss> zero-one: do i have a session open on calpolyswift?
16:37 < swiss> if so, i don't need one
16:37 < gradius> alexjandro: sounds familiar
16:38 < swiss> gradius: remember when i crashed the linode with vps?
16:38 < swiss> errr
16:38 < swiss> s/vps/nethack/
16:38 < gradius> wat
16:38 < gradius> no I dont
16:38 < gradius> haha
16:38 < swiss> one time i had nethack open
16:38 < swiss> and i closed it
16:38 < swiss> then for some reason my nethack kept taking up more and more memory
16:38 < swiss> until i ran calpolyswift clean out of memory with nethack
16:39 < zero-one> swiss: nah, you've got nothing going
16:39 < swiss> zero-one: didn't think so
16:39 < swiss> i don't use that vps at all~
16:39 < swiss> maybe i should start randomly doing slightly malicious things to fuck with you :P
16:40 < swiss> it'll be practice for you to catch them
16:41 < alexjandro> no
16:41 < gradius> are you talking about on cal poyl swift?
16:41 < gradius> because if that's the case
16:41 < gradius> dont fuck with the server.

16:42 < swiss> gradius: why not? :(
16:42 < swiss> randomly fill it up with files
16:43 < zero-one> haha, would you like a banner?
16:44 -!- zero-one is now known as zebro-one
16:44 < gradius> swiss: because we don't need to be creating more shit for everyone to deal with
16:44 < gradius> I understand your thought process of make sure everything is secure, but that's not worth the pain

16:47 < zebro-one> alexjandro: you ACTUALLY want me to make that the banner?
16:48 < alexjandro> yes

16:50 < alexjandro> "Anyone caught using SWIFT computer systems for unlawful and generally unwanted activities will be punished to the full extent of the law."
16:51 < zebro-one> alexjandro: do we have any dates yet?
16:51 < zebro-one> gotta populate that calendar
16:51 < alexjandro> dates for what?
16:51 < zebro-one> SWIFT events
16:51 < zebro-one> first meeting, etc..
16:51 < alexjandro> i added a few things, like all the meetings and fragnite,
16:51 < alexjandro> maybe
16:51 < alexjandro> yes
16:52 < hotdogs> alexjandro: unauthorized use
16:52 < alexjandro> and funsized said that I should wait for the first meeting to add more things
16:52 < hotdogs> will be punished to the full extent of the law
16:52 < alexjandro> hotdogs: whatever
16:53 < swiss> zebro-one: i don't see what you guys could do legally from yes ThIS IS SPACE > space.txt :P
16:54 < swiss> but that'd be too easy. i need better scripts i want to truly take over the world
16:54 < hotdogs> the campus one talks about the california penal code

17:54 < alexjandro> swiss: yes i have 2 helmets
17:54 < swiss> will it fit me?
17:58 < zebro-one> airen: SOMEONE did...
17:58 < zebro-one> alexjandro: WAS IT YOU?
17:58 < swiss> funny, my dad start directing me to do all this work that "needs to get done before company gets here in half an hour"
17:58 < swiss> i throw his own words back at him and say "if you wanted my help you could have asked yesterday" and walk out and leave him to do it
17:58 < zebro-one> gradius: WAS IT YOU?
17:58 < swiss> and he decides the work doesnt need to get done
17:59 < swiss> lololol

18:18 < swiss> zebro-one: check the auth log, who logged in as root recently?
18:22 < zebro-one> hotdogs: I was just kidding
18:22 < zebro-one> on calpolyswift
18:22 < airen> I bet it was zebro-one.
18:22 < airen> Jews like to stir up trouble
18:22 < zebro-one> <_<
18:22 < zebro-one> >_>
18:22 < hotdogs> zebro-one: lolo
19:31 < swiss> time to learn how to set up KVM on gentoo.....
19:31 < swiss> QEMU, ehre i come
19:32 < airen> swiss: It's not hard.
19:33 < airen> swiss: But I doubt your old lappy supports virtualization
19:33 < swiss> jbest wants me to :/
19:33 < swiss> i built kvm into the kernel
19:33 < airen> swiss: yes, but does your processor support it?
19:34 < swiss> airen: where should i check
19:34 < airen> grep -E (vmx|svm) /proc/cpuinfo
19:35 < airen> with the argument to grep in quotes. :X
19:35 < swiss> neither
19:35 < airen> Yeah, your processor doesn't support it.
19:35 < airen> It's going to be so slow it'll blow your mind.
19:36 < swiss> that's what I told jbest
19:36 < airen> Do you have a shitputer you could do it on instead?
19:36 < airen> Alternatively, you could just emerge apache and install it on your lappy.
19:36 < airen> Then unmerge it later.
19:36 < swiss> only the one with a broken screen. But that's also it
19:36 < swiss> but he wants it IN a vm
19:37 < airen> You'll have to tell him it's slightly less than possible.
19:37 < swiss> 19:25:22 <jbest> pentium m never stopped me
19:37 < swiss> :/
19:37 < airen> Virtualbox then?
19:37 < airen> It's still going to be quite slow.
19:38 < swiss> you know what I'm thinking? fuckthat.
19:38 < swiss> I'll put a CMS on my server temporarily
19:39 < airen> Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy
19:39 < swiss> yeah. He's gonna bitch at me though :/
19:40 < airen> What does it matter if it's in a VM or not?
19:40 < swiss> He won't tell me. I don't know if it does matter
19:40 < airen> Well, try going the vbox route.
19:40 < airen> Or straight up qemu
19:41 < airen> Be resourceful.
19:41 < alexjandro> swiss: sure
19:41 < airen> Beat the odds.
19:41 < airen> Believe in the me that believes in you.
19:41 < alexjandro> zebro-one: i dont have sudo
19:42 < swiss> airen: lol. I thought about it. I asked if he just wanted an image to turn in, cause then i could do it on my desktop
19:42 < airen> swiss: Do it in two different ways.
19:42 < airen> With two different CMSes
19:42 < swiss> maybe.
19:42 < swiss> i also have family over tonight (kinda) so I don't know how long I'll have access to my desktop right now
19:47 < swiss> fuck you too mysql
19:47 < swiss> zebro-one: I'm having problems like yours
19:48 < swiss> fuckit, removing apache
19:48 < swiss> this is a terrible idea
19:49 < swiss> nvm
20:02 < swiss> ugh this script might work on a fresh install
20:02 < swiss> but it's derping on mine
20:07 < swiss> jesus. This is way too derpy
20:28 < alexjandro> zebro-one: swiss what problems are you having?
20:28 < DrItanium> alexjandro: That's a contradiction...you assume they don't have problems
20:29 < swiss> alexjandro: way too many~
20:30 < alexjandro> swiss: like what? with the OS or with the CMS
20:30 < swiss> it's mysql
20:30 < swiss> and being stupid and trying to access things it doesn't understand
20:30 < swiss> i'm doing an apt-get upgrade
20:30 < swiss> once it's done i'm gonna try again
20:42 < alexjandro> swiss: also, that album s great to listen to while bike riding.
21:37 < swiss> holy fuck. I almost locked myself out of my VPS trying to set up that thing
21:37 < swiss> it replaces SSH with dropbear
21:37 < alexjandro> lolol
21:38 < swiss> good thing i caught it...
21:47 < swiss> quick, how od i flush all databases in mysql
21:51 < hotdogs> pull the handle
21:51 < zebro-one> swiss: push the red button
21:51 < swiss> already figured it out
21:51 < swiss> mysql -uroot -e "drop database (database name)"
21:51 < swiss> so i made wordpress work with their little script stuff
21:52 < swiss> hmmmm
21:52 < swiss> maybe
21:52 < swiss> oh, i know what the problem is
21:52 < swiss> too much work to fix current issue, gonna call it done
21:53 < swiss> gonna just take the mac mini with me toomorrow
21:53 < swiss> iirc there's one computer with a DVI input in the telecom lab
21:53 < swiss> s/computer/monitor
21:54 < hotdogs> so that's what you meant by flush
21:56 < swiss> yeah...
21:56  * swiss doesn't like mysql
21:56 < swiss> and mysql doesn't like me
22:00 < airen> mysql no thard
22:04 < hotdogs> flush is usually write to disk...not delete
22:05 < hotdogs> empty buffers, that sort of thing
22:26 < zebro-one> flushing buffers, toilets, etc..
22:28 < zebro-one> swiss: speaking of toilets, you should switch from figlet to the superior toilet
22:29 < zebro-one> utilises the awesome libcaca
22:31 < swiss> i use libcaca with jp2a

14:33 < swiss> why am i getting no space left on device when there is 1.4 G left
14:36 < airen> swiss: Are you out of inodes?
14:36 < swiss> airen: how would i check. I don't believe so.
14:37 < airen> http://www.ivankuznetsov.com/2010/02/no-space-left-on-device-running-out-of-inodes.html
14:37 < airen> I'm betting that's it.
14:37 < swiss> you're right
14:37 < airen> Probably inodes from tempfiles.
14:38 < swiss> what would an unusually high number of files be
14:39 < swiss> found it
14:40 < swiss> http://speedcap.net/img/f7e050c7d614ef0dcafff48deecb214c/0a1d46f6.png
14:41 < airen> Tempfiles.
14:41 < airen> Like I thought. :)
14:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: you've done it
14:42 < zero-one> you've finally done it
14:42 < zero-one> i'm listening to kspc at home
14:43 < zero-one> and i'll probably be listening to it on my next bike ride
14:43 < zero-one> and the one after that
14:43 < zero-one> and so on
14:45 < hotdogs> that song wasn't from kspc but okay
14:45 < airen> hotdogs: Found their bandcamp, might get a CD or LP of this album, it's brutal.
14:49 < airen> hotdogs: How should I choose where I embark?
14:49 < hotdogs> what?
14:50 < airen> Df
14:50 < zero-one> hotdogs: what song are you talking about
14:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: because i'm talking about the one i just posted to your facebook
14:51 < zero-one> that we heard on kspc
14:51 < hotdogs> oh
14:51 < hotdogs> well that's without context
14:51 < zero-one> it's old-timey hour right now
14:51 < zero-one> haha
14:51 < zero-one> i love this
14:52 < hotdogs> I was talking about the one earlier at 14:01
15:19 < airen> hotdogs: I'm playing DF is this a good idea? [y/n]
15:25 < hotdogs> y
15:26 < airen> Woooo
15:33 < hotdogs> you'll give up eventually
15:34 < hotdogs> it will be healthy
15:37 < airen> Why will I give up?
15:40 < hotdogs> hunger
15:40 < hotdogs> desperation
15:52 < swiss> hotdogs: would a gentoo VM image (32 bit) work on any Virtualbox (virtualbox image of course)
15:52 < swiss> I ask cause you'd know, I half feel that it would because of the nature of virtualbox, but half feel it wouldn't because gentoo is building around the processor
15:52 < hotdogs> depends on the kernel?
15:53 < hotdogs> and your cflags then, yeah
15:53 < swiss> yeah. Only cflags are " -O2 -march=i686 -pipe"
15:53 < swiss> but I'd imagine 32bit would work on any computer that had a standard intel desktop processor
15:57 < hotdogs> I doubt you can host VMs without being at least i686
15:58 < swiss> so the answer is "yes, it'd work"
15:58 < hotdogs> suuuure
15:59 < swiss> lol
16:38 < zero-one> hotdogs: sleepy time music: http://youtu.be/U_095IAvXCs
16:39 < airen> hotdogs: All my dwarves are dying of thirst
16:39 < hotdogs> trade for alcohol
16:39 < airen> hotdogs: They're all dead.
16:39 < airen> I'll start over.
16:39 < airen> My embark point was shit anyway.
16:43 < zero-one> airen: what game you playin'
16:43 < airen> dorfs
17:42 < swiss> selectively extracting pieces of portage in order to attempt to not run out of inodes
17:44 < swiss> though now that I've compiled the kernel i could jsut delete the source for that
18:35 < DrItanium> swiss: Why don't you compile the packages outside the VM? Save the inodes and make binary packages that are imported into the vm through NFS or something
18:36 < DrItanium> That's what I did for my SSD only install for my laptop. Compiled the packages on spinning rust as binary packages and import them
18:36 < swiss> DrItanium: I 100% could do that, and I might if it comes to that, but i would prefer not to
18:36 < DrItanium> I know it will be faster
18:36 < swiss> the other thing I'm considering doing is squashing my portage tree
18:37 < DrItanium> Even better than that, why don't you just put portage in it's own partition?
18:37 < DrItanium> That way you don't have to worry about inode overflow
18:37 < swiss> trying to keep it under 4GB. Would my inode count go up if I created more partitions?
18:38 < swiss> (i don't understand lots of things about inodes, so the questions I'm asking might be really stupid)
18:38 < airen> swiss: it is a stupid question.
18:38 < DrItanium> yes it is
18:38 < airen> DrItanium: Is saying why not do it outside of the VM
18:38 < swiss> i assume they wouldn't
18:38 < DrItanium> One second let me switch to my lappy...
18:38 < swiss> oh, I'm trying to create a gentoo testing VM that I can try as many kinds of servers by just dragging them around
18:39 < swiss> and if they are reliant on other things then they aren't nicely isolated VMs I could let someone else try downloading
18:39 < DrItanium> There we go
18:40 < DrItanium> swiss: They wouldn
18:40 < DrItanium> This would cut down on the amount of compilation actually
18:40 < swiss> and also, at that point, i might as well go to sabayon i'd imagine
18:41 < DrItanium> If you precompiled the base of the system once and put those binary packages in each vm it would save you a ton of time
18:41 < swiss> the base system compilation thing has been done now
18:41 < DrItanium> But you were talking about multiple VMs
18:42 < swiss> right, and i'm just gonna copy that base VM over and over if I need to create another
18:43 < DrItanium> I would still put portage in it's own partition in the future
18:43 < DrItanium> for reference
18:43 < DrItanium> /dev/mapper/ManausCelerDei-portage  393216 189167  204049   49% /usr/portage
18:43 < swiss> yeah, it seems like a good idea
18:43 < DrItanium> /dev/ManausCelerDei/root             98304   2842   95462    3% /
18:43 < swiss> takes up a lot of inodes, so I'd actually need to allocate more space than it takes up, right?
18:43 < DrItanium> yes
18:43 < swiss> or could i just reduce the block size?
18:44 < DrItanium> you could do that too
18:46 < DrItanium> Anyway, I put in my two cents. I need to get back to writing this damned presentation
19:05 < zero-one> hotdogs: i need a favor
19:05 < zero-one> i need to be put on the swift@csupomona.edu mailing list
19:09 < hotdogs> why
19:19 < zero-one> hotdogs: why not?
19:21 < hotdogs> I don't think that's how this works
19:23 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm on eboard, and it'd be nice if i got the same emails everyone else did
19:24 < hotdogs> "everyone else" is P and VP
20:20 < alexjandro> airen: swiss NSFW http://i.imgur.com/NMS0v.jpg
20:39 < swiss> airen: lol
21:02 < zero-one> hotdogs: when i chmod 700 a user's home directory, FreeBSD complains "Could not chdir to home directory" when they log in
21:06 < hotdogs> is the owner correct
21:11 < zero-one> they're the owners of their own home directories, of course
21:20 < hotdogs> does /home have the right permissions
21:35 < hotdogs> zero-one: DID YOU FIX IT?
21:35 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah
21:36 < hotdogs> what was the issue
21:37 < zero-one> hotdogs: don't wanna say
21:37 < zero-one> <_<
21:37 < zero-one> >_>
21:37 < hotdogs> did you chmod 700 /home
21:37 < zero-one> yes
21:37 < zero-one> <_<
21:38 < zero-one> >_>
21:39 < swiss> he didn't have it chown'd correctly
21:39 < swiss> that's my guess
21:40 < zero-one> swiss: it was chowned correctly
21:40 < zero-one> it just needed to be readable by all
21:40 < swiss> ah
21:40 < zero-one> or
21:40 < zero-one> hm...
21:51 < airen> zero-one: What are you trying to do?
21:53 < zero-one> airen: just trying to make sure people can't see each other's home directories
21:54 < zero-one> i'm working on the BSD machine alexjandro and I set up to run the openVPN server to the lab
21:56 < zero-one> at first i wasn't going to give anyone a home directory
21:56 < zero-one> but i figured there might be some misc. CCDC stuff that people might want to keep on the server
21:56 < zero-one> oh yeah
21:56 < zero-one> we're using it as a file server as well
21:58 < airen> What's complaining about not being able to chdir?
21:58 < hotdogs> zero-one: o=x baby
21:59 < zero-one> airen: i'm confused about exactly that
21:59 < zero-one> i don't know what's complaining
22:00 < zero-one> anyway, it's fixed now
22:00 < zero-one> silly problem
22:12 < swiss> zero-one: oooh it's BSD?
22:13 < swiss> 10/10
22:36 < zero-one> swiss: that's why you only had sh and tcsh
22:36 < swiss> i didn't try anything but bash
22:45 < airen> whereis bash
22:45 < airen> cd $(whereis bash)
22:45 < airen> make install clean
22:47 < swiss> lol
22:47 < swiss> i was pretty privilege stripped
23:08 < alexjandro> yep
23:14 < zero-one> swiss: you're so privileged stripped now that you can't even log in anymore
23:14 < zero-one> lol
23:14 < swiss> hhaha
23:17 < zero-one> airen: just watched that talk you had posted on twitter
23:17 < airen> zero-one: hotdogs showed it to me.
23:17 < zero-one> awesome talk
23:18 < airen> yeah it was.
23:18 < hotdogs> zero-one: OH I POST IT ON FACEBOOK AND YOU IGNORE IT
23:18 < hotdogs> maybe I should write better descriptions
23:18 < hotdogs> naaaaaahhhhhhhh

10:30 < swiss> i'm getting tarantino's for dinner today, it's much better
10:30 < alexjandro> I was thinking Qdoba, did hotdogs like it last week or whenever you guys went?
10:31 < prometheusx> eh, it's pretty much like chipotle
10:32 < hotdogs> except shittier
10:35 < alexjandro> whatever faggots
10:36 < hotdogs> what makes it better than chipotle?
10:36 < prometheusx> alexjandro: weren't you with us when we went to qdabo in vegas?
10:38 < alexjandro> hotdogs: me
10:39 < prometheusx> i want pizza
10:40 < alexjandro> i want tacos
10:44 < hotdogs> alexjandro: but you don't work there
10:45 < swiss> hotdogs: his cousins do
10:45 < alexjandro> No, because i like it
10:45 < hotdogs> why do you like it
10:45 < alexjandro> idk, i just do
10:46 < alexjandro> the steamed tortilla plus i guess i just like their ingredients better
11:00 < alexjandro> hotdogs: timmah so when is lunch, i need to know to plan my showers and drive time
11:01 < timmah> prometheusx: I'm down for pizza
11:02 < hotdogs> sooner rather than later
11:02 < timmah> hotdogs: WHOA WHOA WHOA
11:02 < timmah> LUNCH AT LUNCH TIME?
11:02 < timmah> NO
11:02 < hotdogs> alexjandro: you should always assume lunch is at noon
11:03 < hotdogs> timmah: where's a non-bad pizza place near here
11:03 < hotdogs> with indoor seating and A/C
11:04 < alexjandro> dammit
11:05 < alexjandro> i don't have time to fap and shower now
11:05 < timmah> alexjandro: do both at the same time
11:05 < timmah> WATER IS THE BEST LUBE MAN
11:05 < timmah> hotdogs: there's the itallian place by rubios
11:06 < timmah> but pizza specific? most of them will take ~20 minutes a pie
11:07 < hotdogs> sure
11:10 < hotdogs> does that make it not worth it?
11:13 < timmah> no, it just takes time
11:14 < hotdogs> zero-one: http://soundcloud.com/user3105090/subway-girl
11:15 < swiss> mosin nagats are $120 at big 5 right now
11:15 < swiss> tempting
11:16 < prometheusx> timmah: they have premade pizzas and you can just get slices
11:17 < timmah> http://barrospizza.com/
11:18 < hotdogs> are we going to arizona?
11:18 < prometheusx> sure!
11:18 < swiss> sounds like a plan
11:19 < swiss> cook your pizza on a rock in the desert!
11:20 < alexjandro> timmah: well i shower first, so im clean, then fap, then clean up again. Because i just feel dirty
11:20 < timmah> hotdogs: shit, might not be the same place :(

11:22 < timmah> FUCK YOU
11:25 <@gradius> fuck
11:25 <@gradius> my time is all screwed up on my VPS :(
11:25 <@gradius> and I have to kill my screen session to get the PDT to be set in irssi :(
11:25 <@gradius> bye!
11:25 < hotdogs> wat
11:25 <@gradius> I set my profile to pacific
11:25 <@gradius> but screen is still telling me its 10 at night.
11:26 < hotdogs> HMMM
11:26 <@gradius> but if I log into a new ssh session
11:26 < hotdogs> oh yes
11:26 <@gradius> the correct timezone is reflected.
11:26 <@gradius> Is the only fix to close screen + restart it?
11:26 <@gradius> since I had to log out to get it to reflect it last time.
11:27 < alexjandro> hotdogs: going now
11:27 <@gradius> I wonder why the UTC is so weird on it.

21:45 < airen> this looks way better than D3
21:45 < airen> I actually want to play this.
22:02 < hotdogs> yeah, seen a few clones
22:02 < hotdogs> the gameplay sections make it look a little slow
22:42 < hotdogs> SardoniS is my new car music now
22:42 < hotdogs> the FM transmitter will probably muddy it up a bunch though :(
22:42 < hotdogs> time to get out my shitty CD-Rs
23:18 < hotdogs> alexjandro: you will be delighted to know that I accidentally made catears image search menage a trois in class
23:19 < airen> hotdogs: looooool
23:19 < prometheusx> hotdogs: NICE!
23:20 < hotdogs> she was like "what's with americans and french shit"
23:20 < hotdogs> so I was listing things: french fries, french vanilla, french press, menage a trois...
23:20 < prometheusx> hopefully with safe search off
23:21 < hotdogs> doesn't matter dude
23:21 < prometheusx> does she sit in the front of the class?
23:22 < hotdogs> she said there were people behind her
23:23 < prometheusx> awesome
23:25 < hotdogs> I need to add a policykit rule that lets me do fuckin anything
23:25 < hotdogs> fuck putting in my password constantly
23:30 < prometheusx> hotdogs: what else can we get her to google in class?
23:44 < alexjandro> a what
23:45 < airen> Blue waffle
23:45 < prometheusx> alexjandro: never heard of a menage a trois?
23:50 < swiss> hotdogs: subtle suggestion with her, well done
23:50 < swiss> she isn't in here anymroe
23:52 < hotdogs> she hasn't been for a while
23:52 < hotdogs> she's one of THOSE irc users
23:52 < swiss> ewww
23:52 < swiss> one of... THOSE?
23:55 < airen> >not being on irc 24/7 365
23:56 < prometheusx> yeah, how are we supposed to creep her out?
23:56 < hotdogs> dick pics?
--- Day changed Tue Aug 21 2012
00:00 < prometheusx> oh right, i can email them to her!
00:47 < prometheusx> timmah: i want to go bowling again
00:48 < hotdogs> was it that good?
00:48 < hotdogs> NOW I FEEL BAD
00:48 < prometheusx> hotdogs: YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD
00:50 < hotdogs> I do
00:50 < hotdogs> so bad I'm going to bed
08:10 < timmah> prometheusx: I'm down for it thursday
10:11 < hotdogs> gradius: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2eWUdRb60Y
10:57 < hotdogs> airen: so I was thinking of setting up some music and a stream on my VPS to be constantly playing
10:57 < hotdogs> icecast doesn't play music itself, right?  So I'd have to...put mpd on my vps
10:57 < airen> hotdogs: You can do mpd
10:57 < airen> Or you can do ices2
10:57 < airen> But ices2 only plays ogg iirc
10:57 < airen> Hell if you go as far to do mpd, you can use it's built in http streaming if you so desire.
10:58 < hotdogs> yeah, but I might just leave iceast always up on my vps
10:58 < airen> Or you can bounce it to the localhost icecast server.
10:58 < hotdogs> less goofy ports
10:59 < airen> I'm sure there's another way to do it sans mpd.
10:59 < airen> But mpd is nice and you can either just ssh in to control it, or you can open a port and control it directly over a network connection.
11:00 < hotdogs> yep
11:00 < hotdogs> mpd is definitely the best music daemon I've ever used
11:00 < hotdogs> still feels funny
11:00 < hotdogs> though
11:02 < airen> Funny how?
11:03 < airen> How do you interface with it?
11:03 < hotdogs> just the MPD EVERYWHERE!!! funny
11:04 < airen> Heh.
11:04 < airen> It's a great tool.
11:05 < airen> I love it more than I used to love amaoroK 1.4
11:05 < hotdogs> I never got into the super heavy clients
11:05 < hotdogs> I think I went from winamp -> mpd
11:06 < airen> amaroK was great back in it's heyday
11:06 < DrItanium> airen: amarok 1.4 was awesome
11:06 < airen> Fuck yeah it was.
11:06 < airen> The ability to have a mysql backend was awesome
11:06 < DrItanium> yes
11:06 < DrItanium> and per track artwork
11:06 < hotdogs> that sounds awful
11:07 < hotdogs> the mysql backend bit
11:07 < airen> Then they released the 2.0 branch and it was horrid.
11:07 < airen> hotdogs: You could also use sqlite.
11:07 < DrItanium> airen: We don't talk about 2.0....>_>
11:07 < airen> DrItanium: I tried to like it. But it was such a regressive pile of shit.
11:08 < DrItanium> Yeah, especially the wiki functionality :/
11:08 < DrItanium> And sometimes it would just fuck up totally and not play songs :/
11:08 < hotdogs> airen: as mpd has proven, using an actual database is overkill
11:08 < DrItanium> I use cmus
11:08 < airen> hotdogs: Yeah.
11:08 < airen> hotdogs: mpd is the least likely of any client I know to choke on huge collections.
11:09 < airen> DrItanium: Not to mention the UI was god awful
11:09 < DrItanium> yeah....:(
11:09 < airen> And they removed something like 40% of the features and 60% of the stability.
11:09 < DrItanium> And 100% of my desire to use it
11:10 < hotdogs> I've never really needed album art/big gui stuff for my music anyway
11:10 < DrItanium> They even screwed up the ipod connectivity
11:10 < hotdogs> add all to playlist, set random, go
11:11 < hotdogs> I can't imagine anything that could replace mpd for me now
11:11 < airen> hotdogs: I feel the same way.
11:12 < hotdogs> though I can't remember if I imagined mpd...I think I did, though
11:12 < hotdogs> cause I really wanted the music to not be reliant on the gui existing
11:12 < airen> DrItanium: I think my favorite feature of amarok 1.4 was the queue system.
11:12 < airen> DrItanium: Which 2.0 killed.
11:13 < DrItanium> yup
11:13 < DrItanium> I found it again in cmus :)
11:14 < airen> I think I used exale for a while after amarok
11:14 < airen> Then moved to mpd
11:14 < airen> After I couldn't stand the performance hog that was exaile.
14:17 < hotdogs> timmah: don't know how to fix my phone :(
14:18 < hotdogs> timmah: apparently, complaining in irc and restarting the app makes shit show up
15:02 < timmah> lol
15:02 < timmah> WELL DONE
15:02 < alexjandro> hotdogs: what is wrong with ut
15:02 < alexjandro> it
15:22 < hotdogs> it wasn't showing some music that's on my sdcard
16:11 < alexjandro> and oh
16:27 < hotdogs> indeed

11:04 < gradius> I GUESS I HAVE TO YELL FOR YOU TO HEARME
11:05 < alexjandro> yea
11:05 < gradius> THE NETSPLITS PUT ME ACROSS THIS CHASM
11:05 < alexjandro> yea
11:05 < alexjandro> so how do i make my kernel compile faster
11:05 < gradius> WHAT I DONT UNDERSTAND IS HOW I CAN HEAR YOU WITHOUT YOU YELLING
11:05 < gradius> alexjandro: -j99
11:05 < alexjandro> i have a low deep voice that goes far

11:06 < gradius> haha
11:06 < gradius> well you ask a vague question, I give you a gradius answer.
11:07 < alexjandro> oh
11:07 < alexjandro> okay
11:08 < alexjandro> Because I forgot to compile it with ext4 and i have as my filesystem
12:18 < hotdogs> gradius: if you keep getting netsplit you can always /reconnect too
12:18 < hotdogs> alexjandro: turn off stuff
12:21 < alexjandro> hotdogs: huh?
12:21 < alexjandro> what do you mean turn off stuff
12:25 < hotdogs> pres n
12:25 < hotdogs> don't build things
12:27 < alexjandro> ...okay
12:29 < hotdogs> DON'T COMPILE THINGS YOU AREN'T GOING TO USE
12:31 < alexjandro> oh
12:32 < alexjandro> yea
12:32 < alexjandro> i did that
12:32 < alexjandro> but i didn't realize that when I download new soruces for an updated kernel, it uses a new .config file
12:40 < hotdogs> you can copy the old .config
12:40 < hotdogs> and do make oldconfig
12:40 < airen> I use the old config as a starting point.
12:41 < alexjandro> Well now I know
12:54 < hotdogs> airen: with oldconfig?
12:54 < DrItanium> alexjandro: make -j24 usually does the trick
12:54 < hotdogs> I hate it when I forget and just do make
12:55 < airen> hotdogs: I do it manually usually.
12:55 < airen> Since I usually want to reveiw my options.

21:27 < airen> Actually saw you most recently.
21:27 < alexjandro> haha I know. I was just thinking of that.
21:27 < alexjandro> Are you going to come to SWIFT events when school starts back up.
21:28 < alexjandro> Come for the pizza, stay for the...umm...pizza.
21:29 < airen> I'll potentially go to shit like fagnite
21:29 < airen> And I'm on tap to help out with ALSAS and shit
21:29 < airen> I'd do installerfest as well
21:29 < alexjandro> Thats pretty much all of them, the big ones at least
21:30 < airen> Yeah.
21:30 < airen> At some point I'd like to come back and give a talk.
21:30 < airen> I need to figure out what I'd talk about though.
21:30 < alexjandro> just complain about shit
21:30 < alexjandro> that you don't like
21:31 < alexjandro> and we'll market it as "Old Man yelling about Linux" and you'll be famous on reddit for a day
21:31 < airen> lol
21:37 < zero-one> hahaha
22:26 < drboots> Sounds lie something airen would do alright
22:41 < DrItanium> I should do a talk too.
22:42 < DrItanium> It would be me talking for 37 minutes exactly about various items
22:42 < airen> DrItanium: Your talks are usually more CSS oriented.
22:42 < DrItanium> Oh this one would be just an insane rant
22:42 < airen> DrItanium: That being said, your thesis would be a good tech symposim talk. :)
22:43 < DrItanium> Yes it would be
22:43 < airen> DrItanium: I fail to see the difference.
22:43 < DrItanium> lol
22:43 < DrItanium> The difference being that when it's not I make the audience look at hentai without them realizing it
22:43 < DrItanium> Any joke images I use have been carefully cut out of a hentai of some sort
22:44 < DrItanium> But they're innocuous
22:44 < airen> I lold

12:51 < hotdogs> I think Iw as talking to you about that
12:52 < hotdogs> I don't remember who now
12:52 < zero-one> hahaha
12:53 < zero-one> hotdogs: swiss is bringing matresses

12:54 < swiss> hotdogs: i have inflatible blu ray
12:54 < swiss> I have blazing saddles on blu ray if somone has a player....
12:54 < swiss> but it's my dad's, so I'd prefer not to ask him for it
12:55 < zero-one> swiss: are you seriously bringing inflatable mattresses?
12:55 < swiss> zero-one: i just got back from camping, and I could just throw them back in the car
12:56 < hotdogs> zero-one: with who
12:57 < zero-one> hotdogs: april and i are going halfsies on a hooker

12:59 < zero-one> swiss: ^
13:00 < hotdogs> 6.6gb? wat, just a sec
13:00 < swiss> hotdogs: is yours blu ray?
13:00 < swiss> wait
13:00 < swiss> it doesn't matter
13:00 < hotdogs> no
13:00 < swiss> my projector is 1024x768
13:00 < swiss> it's not HD
13:00 < hotdogs> lol
13:00 < swiss> so it doesn't really matter:P
13:00 < swiss> your copy would be better
13:00 < hotdogs> "no way man, his projector is high quality"
13:01 < hotdogs> 1920x800
13:01 < zero-one> hotdogs: it does well for its size and portability
13:01 < prometheusx> hotdogs: i told you you said bluray
13:02 < swiss> hotdogs: http://www.projectorcentral.com/Samsung-SP-P400B.htm
13:02 < hotdogs> prometheusx: there was a huge ellipsis though
13:02 < swiss> nvm, 1280x1024, but 800x600 native
13:02 < swiss> lolololol
13:03 < zero-one> hotdogs: i hope you're ready for the best night of your life
13:04 < zero-one> i brought safety helmets just in case
13:05 < prometheusx> they're too small for his penis
13:08 < zero-one> swiss: around what time are you gonna get here
13:12 < swiss> 8
13:12 < zero-one> you should come earlier and play magic
13:14 < swiss> traffic, so nope
13:22 < swiss> btw, i got a baraccuda in that
13:22 < swiss> 7200RPM 64 MB cache
13:22 < zero-one> >not 10,000RPM
13:23 < zero-one> DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT 7200
13:23 < swiss> zero-one: got this 3tb for like $100
13:24 < swiss> BIG CP GOING
13:24 < alexjandro> zero-one: what about 7200?
13:24 < airen> >big cp going
13:24 < airen> >call fbi
13:26 < zero-one> airen: fucking lol
13:26 < swiss> airen: might be slightly true :<
13:26 < swiss> I haven't read everything people have uploaded
13:26 < swiss> and I know there's some htat probably need to get deleted
13:26 < swiss> names like "Humiliation Diary" scare me
13:29 < airen> s/scare/arouse/
13:29 < hotdogs> scaredboners
13:29 < prometheusx> fearboner
13:30 < prometheusx> scareroused
13:31 < swiss> airen: truestory
13:43 < alexjandro> i want to eat
13:43 < alexjandro> and i have my lunch next to me but im on the phone
13:44 < hotdogs> ha ha ha ha
13:44 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Tell the person you're on the phone with that you'll call them back
13:45 < alexjandro> not that easy
13:45 < DrItanium> Are you on your lunch break?
13:46 < alexjandro> i want to be
13:46 < DrItanium> By law, you must take a lunch break and you can't be working during it
13:46 < DrItanium> More for future reference
13:47 < zero-one> the punishment for working during your mandatory lunch break is a public flogging
13:48 < DrItanium> Actually the business can get in major trouble if it ever comes to light
13:49 < airen> DrItanium: I have to walk away from my desk to not work during lunch/break.
13:49 < DrItanium> airen: Exactly!
13:49 < DrItanium> Same with me
13:50 < hotdogs> alexjandro: how long have you been working
13:50 < hotdogs> I think there's also something about when the lunch break occurs
13:52 < airen> There is.
13:53 < alexjandro> its all good
14:01 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Stop being so mellow about it >_>
14:01 < alexjandro> i meant to say "its all good now"
14:01 < alexjandro> as in no more phone
14:02 < alexjandro> and yea food
14:02 < alexjandro> yes*
14:02 < DrItanium> Oh
14:02 < DrItanium> Excellent!
14:16 < swiss> why is my 3tb drive reading as 350 GB?
14:16 < swiss> http://pastebin.com/XhAhFP6p
14:17 < alexjandro> Digital Dust
14:17 < alexjandro> you got an old drive
14:17 < alexjandro> Because you have a 350GB partition on it?
14:17 < swiss> alexjandro: tmk i don't..
14:18 < alexjandro> well it sees /dev/sda3 at 3000GB
14:18 < swiss> oh wait...
14:18 < alexjandro> but the partition err, 1
14:18 < alexjandro> err
14:18 < alexjandro> no numbers
14:18 < alexjandro> /dev/sda is 3000GB, /dev/sda1 is 350GB
14:21 < DrItanium> swiss: Did you format it as MBR?
14:21 < DrItanium> IF so go back and reformat it as GPT
14:21 < DrItanium> Or it's a special partition that seagate put on there
14:22 < swiss> DrItanium: there's the issue
14:22 < DrItanium> MBR will only allow 2.2 TB
14:22 < DrItanium> max
14:22 < swiss> i'm gonna have the disk be xfs, should i be doing gpt or bsd?
14:22 < swiss> i haven't heard of bsd label
14:22 < alexjandro> wat
14:22 < DrItanium> bsd?
14:22 < alexjandro> bsdfs?
14:22 < DrItanium> Fucking use gpt
14:22 < swiss> but i'll actually be running bsd on here soon
14:22 < DrItanium> GPT is the partition layout
14:23 < DrItanium> it's not a file system
14:23 < swiss> http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/manual/html_chapter/parted_2.html#SEC16
14:23 < swiss> DrItanium: ^
14:23 < DrItanium> MBR and GPT are partition layouts
14:23 < zero-one> swiss: you don't need GPT, MBR should be fine
14:23 < DrItanium> not file systems
14:23 < DrItanium> zero-one: On a 3 TB HDD?
14:23 < swiss> zero-one: on a 3tb/
14:23 < zero-one> DrItanium: oh
14:23 < zero-one> shit
14:23 < DrItanium> zero-one: You're a fucking idiot
14:23 < alexjandro> swiss: use ext4 for your partition layout
14:23 < zero-one> DrItanium: you're adopted
14:23 < DrItanium> zero-one: probably
14:24 < DrItanium> alexjandro: lol
14:24 < alexjandro> swiss: but make sure that ext4 is compiled into the kernel, or you're gonna have a bad time
14:24 < swiss> alexjandro: mendez was saying to use XFS if I'm gonna be running bsd
14:24 < DrItanium> swiss: The partition scheme is separate from the file system
14:24 < DrItanium> so GPT + XFS
14:24 < DrItanium> or GPT + BSDFS
14:25 < DrItanium> I use a HWRAID6 with a GPT layout with LVM and a ton of EXT4 volumes
14:25 < swiss> fuck, i don't like parted
14:25 < swiss> i like fdisk that nicely says "this is where you should start it and end it
14:25 < DrItanium> parted is hard to work with but it's the only option on ia64 :/
14:25 < DrItanium> swiss: use gdisk
14:26 < alexjandro> DrItanium: port something else to it
14:26 < DrItanium> gdisk <-
14:27 < swiss> should i be making it Linux LVM
14:27 < swiss> oh wait, no
14:27 < swiss> freebsd zfs
14:28 < swiss> wait no
14:28 < swiss> fff
14:28 < swiss> finally figured it out
14:29 < DrItanium> swiss: Good idea would be to figure out what you're going to do with it first
14:29 < DrItanium> I'm not sure what zfs needs in the way of partition identifiers so good luck!
14:29 < swiss> DrItanium: i'm just using 8300 (linux partition)
14:30 < swiss> and it's gonna be the storage drive for my sftp server
14:30 < DrItanium> but that's what I'm saying, I don't know how ZFS does things
14:30 < swiss> i meant xfs anyway xD
14:30 < DrItanium> fuck fuck fuck fuck
14:30 < swiss> if it mounts, i don't have an issue
14:30 < swiss> i just put it on there, now I'm doing mkfs.xfs on it
14:31 < swiss> if it works, yay, if not, time to learn
14:31 < DrItanium> just make sure that you did a gpt partition table, otherwise you'll loose 800 gigs
14:31 < DrItanium> *lose
14:32 < swiss> yeah ,it's gpt
14:32 < DrItanium> Then you're good to go
14:32 < swiss> this mkfs.xfs isn't finishing...
14:32 < swiss> been runnign for 3-4 minutes already. 800G took it maybe 10 seconds
14:32 < DrItanium> Plus you can have more than four primary partitions (256)...although LVM could take care of that
14:32 < DrItanium> swiss: Let it be
14:32 < hotdogs> only 256? not enough
14:33 < DrItanium> 256 primary partitions?
14:33 < hotdogs> NOT ENOUGH
14:33 < swiss> hotdogs: i want one partition per movie file! :P
14:33 < DrItanium> 18 yottabytes total space?
14:33 < hotdogs> NOT ENOUGH
14:33 < DrItanium> Everyone's a critic
14:33 < swiss> yolobytes?
14:33 < swiss> if we're not causing issues/stress, we're not having fun
14:34 < zero-one> swiss: yolobytes
14:34 < zero-one> fucking lol
14:34 < swiss> The most badass kind of bytes :P
14:34 < DrItanium> Sorry, 128 partitions not 256
14:34 < swiss> zero-one: i need to learn LVM. You'll need to teach me later
14:35 < zero-one> swiss: yessir
14:35 < zero-one> not entirely complicated
14:35 < hotdogs> oh man, the lv pv vg talk
14:35 < DrItanium> and it's only 9.8 zettabytes not yottabytes
14:35 < swiss> didn't think so, but guides probably try to teach me too much
14:36 < DrItanium> sorry 9.4 (fuck I can't read today)
14:39 < swiss> DrItanium: erm.... the mkfs is still going
14:39 < swiss> is that a bad thing
14:39 < swiss> been ~10 minutes now
15:00 < DrItanium> What does htop say?
15:00 < DrItanium> I'm not sure how xfs formats, I've never used it
15:02 < swiss> well, i hard reset the computer, and it was formatted
15:02 < swiss> cause SSH froze
15:02 < swiss> and it's a headless
15:05 < hotdogs> wat
15:05 < hotdogs> I wouldn't trust that filesystem at all
15:05 < swiss> ┐(‘～`；)┌
15:05 < swiss> you're probably right
15:06 < swiss> fuckit, ext4
15:06 < hotdogs> they'll probably all take a while to format
15:06 < hotdogs> you're doing 3tb right?
15:07 < swiss> ext4 took around 30 seconds
15:07 < swiss> xfs froze it
15:08 < hotdogs> enterprise!
15:09 < alexjandro> wht is it when I switch to this channel my term gets fucked up
15:10 < swiss> alexjandro: cause you're not handling utf8 correctly

17:42 < gradius> ITS FUN WHEN IT HURTS
17:47 < zero-one> oh my...
17:47 < alexjandro> I think having 2 computers is better than having one computer with 2 screens
17:47 < alexjandro> For working
17:48 < airen> I want another screen :(
17:49 < alexjandro> well I used to work on laptop + external monitor, but today I did desktop and laptop and it was a lot better i think
17:49 < alexjandro> because I could vpn in on the laptop, and still have normal internet on the desktop
17:49 < alexjandro> now i need to setup synergy
17:50 < alexjandro> no, now i need to go hom
17:50 < alexjandro> home*
17:50 < airen> Uh, just ssh tunnel a secondary browser for fucking around?
17:51 < alexjandro> What about network shares. dat windows
17:55 < airen> lol
18:01 < hotdogs> fix their vpn so it doesn't need to be the gateway
18:08 < zero-one> alexjandro: http://www.benchmade.com/products/141
18:08 < zero-one> i almost bought one of these for myself
18:08 < zero-one> a friend of mine has one, and it's awesome
18:09 < zero-one> good for fixing to your boot or leg or something
18:09 < zero-one> also, dat tanto
18:09 < airen> zero-one: I want a Gerber lmfII
18:10 < zero-one> sexiness
18:11 < airen> I know right?
18:12 < zero-one> hotdogs: i get the feeling you'd like this: http://youtu.be/ttLw2eFUb0k
18:13 < hotdogs> I ALREADY HATE IT
18:14 < hotdogs> CLOSED
18:19 < airen> zero-one: Blech

18:21 < airen> What to do for dinner~
18:21 < hotdogs> indeed
18:22 < airen> Just clocked out.
18:22 < airen> Hungry, but also lazy.
18:23 < hotdogs> my bread is almost done
18:25 < alexjandro> for me?
18:27 < hotdogs> yeah
18:27 < hotdogs> you just have to come pay for it
18:27 < alexjandro> k
18:27 < airen> I should make bread
18:31 < swiss> haltin da lappy, then driving out
18:31 < airen> TO WHERE
18:38 < alexjandro> NOWHERE
18:39 < alexjandro> swiss: hurry sweetie
18:42 < hotdogs> this is the worst movie night ever
18:46 < prometheusx> hotdogs: WHY!
18:46 < prometheusx> i'll be there buddy!
18:50 < zero-one> why the fuck won't iproute destroy this interface
18:50 < zero-one> *iproute2
18:51 < zero-one> it didn't create it, does that have something to do with it?
18:51 < hotdogs> what interface
18:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: some interface that qemu or some shit made for NAT-ing the VM
18:51 < hotdogs> you need to use a magic tuntap command for that
18:52 < zero-one> but why won't iproute2 do anything?
18:53 < hotdogs> because it's a network interface provided elsewhere by the kernel
18:53 < hotdogs> apparently you use add/delete for vlans
18:54 < hotdogs> oh man
18:54 < hotdogs> you can use it for a bunch of stuff
18:56 < airen> one binary to rule them all
18:57 < hotdogs> iproute2 isn't one binary
19:01 < hotdogs> also fyi I can bring a 1080p version but I can't bring a computer capable of playing it.
19:01 < hotdogs> well, playing it in real time.  I assume that's a requirement
19:02 < alexjandro> I can!
19:02 < alexjandro> dat windows
19:03 < alexjandro> err
19:03 < alexjandro> wat
19:03 < alexjandro> i mean i5
19:04 < hotdogs> yay
19:05 < alexjandro> as long as it'll play in vlc, we'll be good
19:06 < hotdogs> sure
19:06 < hotdogs> do you have vga out?
19:12 < hotdogs> oh man, I think I could drive both screens in p2-7 from my laptop
19:12 < hotdogs> too bad it can't do 1080p
19:24 < alexjandro> yea vga
19:24 < alexjandro> who doesnt?
19:25 < hotdogs> I was expecting you not to, to complicate things
19:29 < hotdogs> also, fyi, 1920x800 at 800x600 = 800x250
19:29 < hotdogs> squinting simulator
19:30 < alexjandro> what?
19:31 < hotdogs> maintaining aspect ratio
19:31 < hotdogs> cause it's super duper wide
19:32 < alexjandro> well see
19:32 < alexjandro> stop getting all sciencey
19:34 < hotdogs> I CAN'T STOP

15:07 < zero-one> this boot is one of those boots where my machine only sees 4GB of the 6GB that I have installed
15:08 < zero-one> and i only realized this after i started emerging 3 things at the same time
15:08 < zero-one> i have 580MB left
15:08 < zero-one> DON'T FAIL ME NOW
15:09 < zero-one> oh god 540

15:11 < zero-one> 189
15:24 < airen> "one of those boots where my machine only sees ..." zero-one sounds like you have a problemo
15:24 < zero-one> airen: it's been a problem
15:25 < airen> Bad mobo?
15:25 < airen> bad ram?
15:25 < airen> Have you done a ramtest?
15:25 < airen> er memtest
15:25 < zero-one> it's not bad memory
15:25 < zero-one> the motherboard itself doesn't see one of the sticks at random
15:26 < airen> That's not bueno.
15:26 < zero-one> waiting until i have a million dollars
15:26 < zero-one> then i'm getting a new mobo and and ivy bridge
15:26 < airen> ENJOY YOUR EFI
15:27 < zero-one> oh man, now i can surf the web without booting a real OS
15:27 < zero-one> it's what i always wanted
16:20 < DrItanium> airen: EFI is a replacement for BIOS nothing more.
16:20 < DrItanium> zero-one: EFI does not come with web browser....that is added by the motherboard manufacturer
16:20 < DrItanium> zero-one: Also it sounds like you've got a triple channel issue
16:23 < airen> DrItanium: Dunno how I feel about EFI stubs on a FAT partition.
16:26 < DrItanium> You mean EFI system partition?
16:26 < DrItanium> You can erase that partition if you're not going to boot off of it
16:48 < zero-one> DrItanium: i know that

15:35 < prometheusx> timmah: wait, wait, this isn't trying to guess his password!
15:35 < timmah> nah, it's just dicking with his logs
15:36 < timmah> if you wanted to do bruteforce ssh

17:25 < hotdogs> so it should have come out sunday
17:29 < gradius> hotdogs: I wanna play on that server b/c theres rioters + arenanet devs :o
17:33 < hotdogs> BUT I'M ALREADY 30
17:34 < hotdogs> actually I can't find a definitive source on whether guesting is in or not
17:34 < hotdogs> for example, I have no idea if the people I meet when running around in a zone are all of my same home world
17:34 < hotdogs> I don't see why they have to be
17:35 < hotdogs> but yeah, I've already accepted that I won't be playin with the random people I know
17:35 < hotdogs> and I will take joy in killing rioters in wvw
17:46 < alexjandro> hotdogs: no, added the allow work/deny all for 22 before related/established of course
17:46 < hotdogs> well done
17:46 < alexjandro> then i went and removed the allow work rule first
17:46 < alexjandro> then my ssh died
17:46 < hotdogs> I wonder why
17:51 < alexjandro> me too
19:27 < zero-one> airen: http://youtu.be/QgcvB7X-mtA
20:31 < gradius> hotdogs: don't they allow free transfers?
20:33 < hotdogs> for now
20:33 < hotdogs> what am I going to do, transfer every time I want to play with a specific person?
20:35 < timmah> BOWLAN?
20:35 < gradius> YES
20:35 < gradius> DO IT :)

20:41 < timmah> leaving
20:45 < gradius> timmah: I can't play tribes :( I suck at it, also finishing work stuff
20:45 < gradius> hotdogs: got it heh
20:45 < gradius> is there cross server questing + dungeoning? idk how the server instancing stuff works
20:46 < alexjandro> http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~psyc351/Images/AntsFace.jpg
20:46 < gradius> lol
20:46 < hotdogs> gradius: well there's supposed to be guesting
20:46 < hotdogs> but it's apparently not in yet
20:46 < gradius> hotdogs: that's what Iw as just going to ask
20:46 < hotdogs> hence free transfers
20:46 < gradius> got it.
20:47 < gradius> so guesting is just that
20:47 < gradius> like questing cross server.
20:47 < hotdogs> yeah
20:48 < hotdogs> then you murder eachother in wvw
20:49 < hotdogs> I'm guessing I'll just play with people in guesting, hopefully it gets in soon
20:49 < gradius> got it :P
20:50 < gradius> yeah
21:04 < timmah> hotdogs: are youncoming?

10:39 < timmah> gradius: I'm around, so sure
10:39 < gradius> yay!
10:44 < timmah> raspberry pi delayed another 5 weeks

10:50 < timmah> not like it's in high demand or anything
10:51 < timmah> oh fuckingfuck
10:52 < DrItanium> I got my nerf gun from woot today :D
10:52 < DrItanium> PEW PEW PEW
10:52 < timmah> DrItanium: nice
10:53 < DrItanium> timmah: You should program a raspberry pi to solve NP-Complete problems ;)
10:53 < DrItanium> I was tempted to try and trick funsized into doing it with his rpi
10:54 < timmah> lol
10:54 < timmah> looks like I'm getting it anyways
10:54 < DrItanium> You should buy three so you can juggle them
10:54 < timmah> to cancel my order, I have to have an account. to have an account, you have to be UK
10:54 < DrItanium> Wait...then how did you order it?
10:54 < timmah> DrItanium: I dig this, attach batteries to them so they run too?
10:54 < timmah> DrItanium: I'm not sure
10:54 < DrItanium> And when you drop one...bam ELECTRIC SHOCK
10:55 < DrItanium> lol...wat
10:55 < timmah> they had a specific website for ordering them, that's how
10:55 < timmah> I found it, and there's a cancel button
10:56 < timmah> hmm...
10:56 < timmah> now do I really want to do this
10:56 < DrItanium> I wouldn't
10:56 < DrItanium> But I guess the biggest question is are you going to run linux?
10:56 < timmah> DrItanium: that's a silly question
10:57 < hotdogs> timmah: just forget about it
10:57 < DrItanium> You could run RISCOS....:(
10:57 < hotdogs> then when it arrives you'll be like OH MY
10:57 < DrItanium> timmah: Just like with my itanium box you should use it as a primary desktop
10:57 < timmah> hotdogs: present from past timmah
10:57 < hotdogs> ytes
10:57 < timmah> DrItanium: oh god yes
10:57 < timmah> get rid of my clunky desktop
10:57 < DrItanium> You'll hate yourself for getting so spoiled though....
10:57 < timmah> run only off that
10:58 < DrItanium> Oh you won't want to do that
10:58 < DrItanium> Trust me
10:58 < DrItanium> I have dual 1.5 ghz + 8gb ram in this zx6000 and it's sluggish
10:58 < DrItanium> You'll have an easier time because gcc and clang do not eat a bag of dicks (or just refuse) when it comes to code quality
10:58 < airen> DrItanium: Needs more poulson
10:59 < DrItanium> airen: FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU :(

10:59 < airen> The place where computers go to die.
11:00 < gradius> airen: you want it? :P
11:00 < airen> timmah: They're still competitive on price.
11:00 < hotdogs> athlon xps were so goooood
11:00 < airen> gradius: Not really.
11:00 < DrItanium> In AMD's defense, they've just been late to market continually
11:00 < gradius> I can't take it to new home, they don't allow old things.
11:00 < timmah> airen: on price, but not power
11:00 < gradius> more like, I'm never going to use it.
11:00 < gradius> :(
11:00 < airen> timmah: True.
11:00 < DrItanium> bulldozer was supposed to be 2010 not 2011
11:00 < airen> gradius: I don't want an old sun workstation, but I'll take a gradius.
11:00 < gradius> <3
11:00 < timmah> airen: I really wish amd had something to compete with the i7/i9 series
11:01 < DrItanium> timmah: i9's don't exist anymore do they?
11:01 < DrItanium> yeah they stopped those with sandy bridge EX
11:02 < DrItanium> AMD is competing on the low end more than the high end these days
11:02 < DrItanium> What they need is an HD 4000 series but for the desktop
11:02 < DrItanium> *desktop processor
11:02 < hotdogs> timmah: meeting at 1? fuqqqqq
11:03 < DrItanium> Also the university village just hit new lows....they mis-spelled Maintenance as Maintnance
11:03 < hotdogs> of all the things they do, that's their new low?
11:03 < timmah> DrItanium: wtb 12nm cpu pst
11:04 < timmah> hotdogs: so early lunch?
11:04 < DrItanium> timmah: Wat?
11:04 < DrItanium> I only parsed 12 nm cpu
11:04 < DrItanium> And something about pacific standard time
11:05 < timmah> DrItanium: don't worry about it
11:05 < DrItanium> I don't really think buying fake 12nm cpus will do anything
11:06 < gradius> timmah: what's early lunch to you?
11:06 < hotdogs> timmah: perhaps, perhaps
11:06 < timmah> oh they'll get there
11:06 < gradius> b/c I could eat now if want be?
11:06 < timmah> gradius: yes
11:06 < timmah> hotdogs: let's go pick him up
11:06 < hotdogs> ARE WE GOING NOW?
11:06 < timmah> hotdogs: YEP
11:07 < gradius> k gimme a sec and ill meet you at village guest?
11:07 < timmah> gradius: rgr
11:07 < hotdogs> okays
11:09 < gradius> alright you guys on your way? I'm going out there.
11:10 < timmah> gradius: sure?
11:16 < prometheusx> sure!
11:44 < swiss> gradius: ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING WITH OTHERS?
11:44 < swiss> ONLY WHEN I'M NOT IN POMONA, EH?
11:44 < swiss> I SEE HOW IT IS
11:44  * swiss goes and cries in the corner
11:47 < alexjandro> swiss: I know that feel. The one day I'm in Santa Monica and he works from home.
11:55 < alexjandro> Here here swiss, it's okay...
11:55  * alexjandro rubs swiss on the back
11:55  * swiss sniffles
11:56 < prometheusx> get a room you two
11:58 < alexjandro> i wish
12:35 < gradius> okay
12:35 < hotdogs> alexjandro: soon he will always be in santa monica
12:35 < hotdogs> :(
12:35 < gradius> so I tried palying a different character.
12:36 < gradius> and it works fine.
12:36 < gradius> that character is bugged.
12:36 < hotdogs> strange
12:36 < gradius> Guess I dont really need a plant lady.
12:36 < gradius> HUMAN IT IS
12:36 < gradius> but meh, playing my necro now is fun
12:36 < gradius> also yeah :( I'll be farther away.
12:36 < gradius> It's not like I plan to not see you all :(
12:38 < alexjandro> gradius: we will make sure to plan a swift field trip to Riot, okay?
12:38 < alexjandro> so that we can get noobs in ccdc
12:38 < alexjandro> and use you as an example
12:38 < gradius> sure!
12:38 < hotdogs> gradius: NOOO DO PLANT LADY
12:38 < alexjandro> "JOIN CCDC AND GO WORK AT RIOT"
12:39 < hotdogs> I guess titty lady is okay too
12:39 < gradius> lolol hotdogs
12:47 < hotdogs> where'd zero go?
12:49 < alexjandro> idk
12:49 < alexjandro> he got buttmad last night
12:49 < hotdogs> he ragequit facebook as well
12:50 < alexjandro> lol really?
12:50 < alexjandro> maybe he wanted to get work done
12:51 < hotdogs> maybe
12:51 < hotdogs> I texted him the link I wanted to send through google voice
12:51 < hotdogs> HA HA HA
12:51 < gradius> hoyl shit
12:51 < gradius> he did ragequit facebook
12:51 < gradius> what happened? :o
12:52 < hotdogs> buttmad at #swift
12:52 < timmah> wat
12:52 < swiss> ^
12:52 < timmah> confused, but don't know if I care enough
12:52 < swiss> yeah, he got buttmad over airen's bashing at rainbows
12:53 < timmah> so what's new?
12:53 < hotdogs> no
12:53 < gradius> idk why he's so sensitive :(
12:53 < gradius> dude it's irc
12:53 < alexjandro> hes a babby
12:53 < gradius> get over it
12:53 < alexjandro> no thick skin yet
12:53 < gradius> But that's like uber babby.
12:53 < gradius> I was never that babby
12:54 < alexjandro> me neither
12:54 < gradius> only time I ever got mad at IRC was when jbest kept kicking me for my IRC bot
12:54 < gradius> that didnt do anything
12:54 < gradius> haha
12:54 < alexjandro> it invented this!
12:54 < swiss> http://pastebin.com/qhXmLcZd
12:54 < hotdogs> pretty sure it was 22:05:46 < airen> grayscale: Don't get all zero-one crybabby on me.
12:55 < alexjandro> pretty sure i don't care
12:55 < hotdogs> pretty sure I don't care that you don't care
12:55 < swiss> lol
12:55 < DrItanium> Ah so that's why it's somewhat quieter
12:55 < swiss>  ┐(‘～`；)┌
12:55 < gradius> lolololololol
12:55 < gradius> god damn
12:55 < gradius> dude seriously
12:56 < swiss> I dunno, when people do shit like that to me in #swift I just let it blow over in general. I don't know what the whole buttmad thing is about
12:56 < gradius> stop being so babby.
12:56 < DrItanium> I usually just let it go
12:56 < gradius> swiss: I agree, even if it's something that like
12:56 < DrItanium> Or just make a plithy comeback
12:56 < alexjandro> No, I go along with it
12:56 < gradius> about some serious shit that im all like upset about
12:56 < gradius> its fucking irc
12:56 < gradius> get over it
12:56 < gradius> alexjandro: yeah I usually do the same
12:56 < swiss> exactly!
12:57 < swiss> i mean, hell, they were bashing me right before he started bashing rainbows. Did I give a fuck? no.
12:57 < alexjandro> lololololol
12:57 < hotdogs> I think it's normal to quit abrasive irc channels
12:57 < alexjandro> im on hold for financial aid, and the sexy sax man song starts playing
12:57 < DrItanium> To be honest, rainbows deserves it most of the time when she tries to take control of the channel
12:58 < swiss> hotdogs: yeah, but there's a difference between quitting and getting buttmad
12:58 < gradius> i mean, all emotionalness aside
12:58 < swiss> he quit *all* of IRC and posted "I'm out" on FB
12:58 < gradius> the channel is full of dicks
12:58 < gradius> but
12:58 < hotdogs> YOU GET BUTTMAD AT A CHANNEL TOO OFTEN, SO YOU STOP HANGING OUT IN IT
12:58 < DrItanium> Did he delete his FB?
12:58 < gradius> you gotta go in with that and just say fuck it to what they said
12:58 < gradius> and yes
12:58 < gradius> he deleted facebook
12:58 < gradius> at least, I cant access it
12:59 < DrItanium> Damn
12:59 < alexjandro> or turned it off
12:59 < hotdogs> I get angry at IRC all the time
12:59 < alexjandro> hotdogs: fix it
12:59 < hotdogs> FUCK YOU
12:59 < alexjandro> lol
12:59 < swiss> hotdogs: FUCK YOU TOO
12:59 < swiss> <3
12:59 < DrItanium> That's a pretty crappy way to protest something
12:59 < hotdogs> #swift has always been jerks, it was just never quite so personal
12:59 < hotdogs> kicking for saying wat, shit like that
13:00 < swiss> they don't kick me so much anymore cause I think I've made it clear it's not as funny anymore
13:00 < gradius> idk some people in the channel feed of shit like that
13:00 < gradius> being dicks
13:00 < swiss> by not rejoining for a while
13:00 < gradius> and some people cant take dicks
13:00 < gradius> but whatever
13:00 < alexjandro> THE RULES ARE STUPID
13:00 < DrItanium> Keep in mind I have no clue what all was said....wait yes I do -_-;
13:00  * DrItanium looks through the logs
13:00 < gradius> maybe Im just so tuned out of it.
13:01 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: shim tian worta mign top pan
13:01 < alexjandro> wat
13:02 < DrItanium> I just read it....meh....everyone has their own story
13:02 < swiss> well, a long time ago, when I was first joining CCDC, i think airen put it well. He said "Yeah, people tease me in the channel, and we make fun of each other and it's funny cause we're friends. I'm not friends with you yet, so it's not funny when you try to make fun of me." I'm not friends with everyone in #swift, and when certain people (like airen) joke around, and kick me it's fine. However, when some other people do it (like jbest) it seems more malic
13:03 < alexjandro> lol really
13:03 < gradius> yeah im not going to say zero was in the wrong, but I cant really tell how people feel so yeah
13:03 < DrItanium> I would put the line out there that they wouldn't say it if it was true...but I believe that most people are generally good natured
13:03 < gradius> ya :
13:03 < swiss> i'm gonna go with "he's being overly sensative"
13:03 < swiss> not that he's wrong
13:03 < DrItanium> Deleting the FB seems extremely excessive
13:03 < DrItanium> That's the only part that gets me
13:04 < gradius> yah :|
13:04 < gradius> welp
13:04 < gradius> we always have #testgradius!
13:04 < gradius> :)
13:04 < gradius> haha
13:04 < swiss> lol
13:04 < alexjandro> swiss: i see swift as a free for all
13:04 < swiss> #fun-swift
13:04 < swiss> lol
13:04 < gradius> hahah
13:04 < DrItanium> Fuck, I've been pissed at #swift so I just set to away and just go do other things until I cool off
13:04 < alexjandro> so you make a jab at me and i can jab back, its weird what airen said
13:04 < gradius> #idontgiveaflyingfuckwhathappenshere
13:05 < alexjandro> unless you were making fun of him in pms
13:05 < alexjandro> pm's*
13:05 < gradius> yeah I agree there.
13:05 < swiss> alexjandro: but if I start making fun of you in #swift it's one thing, but if someone I haven't even met (like F0rgotten) started making fun of me it'd seem malicious
13:05 < gradius> if it goes more personal, and not just for humor...
13:05 < gradius> that seems more attacking.
13:06 < swiss> in #swift, if you're new (last 3 years) you have to obey certain rules, and not be a dick to those >3 years in swift
13:06 < alexjandro> but i am in those last 3 years
13:06 < swiss> alexjandro: and you get kicked on occasion
13:06 < gradius> tbh
13:06 < DrItanium> Or your in the group that I'm in where I can say crap and get away with it because it boggles peoples mind :D
13:07 < gradius> there shouldnt be fucking hierarchy
13:07 < swiss> DrItanium: lol
13:07 < gradius> just be fucking friends
13:07 < gradius> stop bitching if you get kicked
13:07 < gradius> and come back when you're unbanned
13:07 < gradius> if you don't get unbanned, fuck it.
13:07 < swiss> well, I'd argue with that a bit. A bit of the kicking/banning is overly dickish
13:07 < gradius> ive never seen anyone that didnt deserve it get perma banned
13:07 < gradius> well yeah
13:07 < gradius> kick+ban does go a bit over the line
13:07 < swiss> i wasn't gonna rejoin #swift after some shit jbest was pulling on me -_-
13:07 < alexjandro> haha i remember one night when i just started and was in irc at like 3am, and rnd joined when he was still over seas, and he was like "Who are you?" and I replied back with "Who are you?"
13:08 < alexjandro> this was before I knew who he was
13:08 < gradius> and jbest is kinda a dick when it comes to kick+ban
13:08 < gradius> but jbest is a dick peroiod.
13:08 < gradius> period*
13:08 < swiss> alexjandro: it's cause both you and rnd are thick skinned
13:08 < alexjandro> yea
13:09 < DrItanium> See I have to play opposite side of the coin (I'm an asshole like that). I would say that if you talk to jbest in real life he is a really nice guy though. Layer of indirection adds the asshole to the equation
13:09 < gradius> Ill be completely honest, I check #testgradius before I do #swift now...
13:09 < swiss> The people I'm on good terms with in #swift are mostly in this channel. Besides that, I don't make fun of many people
13:09 < gradius> swiss: exactly.
13:09 < gradius> lol
13:09 < swiss> DrItanium: I see him pretty often. He's a dick to me. Period.
13:09 < gradius> only shit ive been kicked for is bots and drinking.
13:09 < DrItanium> Interesting.....:/
13:09 < gradius> and the drinking was a favor to me.
13:09 < DrItanium> gradius: the drinking....lol that was a favor
13:09 < gradius> yeah
13:09 < swiss> DrItanium: tbqh, he's not a dick to you cause you're part of the "old crowd"
13:10 < swiss> not thing bad on you
13:10 < DrItanium> I started in 2010
13:10 < DrItanium> maybe late 2009
13:10 < DrItanium> As I said, I'm just fucking crazy in what I say
13:10 < timmah> ./topic get-in-touch-with-your-feelings hour
13:10 < swiss> yes, but you've also been good friends with airen/mendez for a long time, and all that
13:10 < DrItanium> timmah: NO UNIX INVOCATION ALLOWED HERE...BLEH BLEH
13:10 < swiss> jbest sees you as a peer.
13:10 < timmah> DrItanium: I only do ./ because / by itself would give me errors
13:10 < DrItanium> mendez yes airen not as long
13:11 < DrItanium> timmah: I'm just messing with you :D
13:11 < swiss> timmah: /say /topic
13:11 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: discuss your feelings, bitch about other irc channels.
13:11 < timmah> swiss: too much effort
13:11 < timmah> gradius: I approve
13:11 < gradius> timmah: I do the same thing a lot when emulating / commands
13:11 < swiss> timmah: space + /
13:11 < swiss> :P
13:11 < gradius> mostly because I did that a lot for Ragnarok Online
13:11 < swiss> welp, time to go pick up my friend
13:11 < swiss> ttyl
13:11 < gradius> when writing sarcastic emotes.
13:11 < timmah> gradius: highfive
13:11 < gradius> like /seeifigiveafuck
13:12 < DrItanium> My problem with #swift is that if I say anything random....BAM channel shuts down for like 47 minutes until, I guess, it's safe to come out of the bomb shelter.....
13:12 < alexjandro> yes
13:13 < gradius> I can just say shit
13:13 < gradius> and people ignore me
13:13 < DrItanium> Although I will give it credit for not kicking me for 45 minutes of straight puns
13:13 < gradius> feels good man
13:13 < gradius> dude
13:13 < DrItanium> or was it an hour and 45 minutes
13:13 < gradius> you had people at work fucking rofling at the puns
13:13 < DrItanium> really?
13:13 < DrItanium> excellent
13:13 < timmah> gradius: when you say things people always say cactus
13:13 < gradius> we were doing our 36 hour straight coding hackathon
13:13 < gradius> and everything was super fucking funny
13:14 < DrItanium> Woooo
13:14 < gradius> and I was showing everyone our #swift channel
13:14 < gradius> they lvoed it haha
13:14 < alexjandro> "Good, let the hate flow through you!" is what we should say when people get buttmad
13:15 < DrItanium> alexjandro: YES!!!! WE MUST!
13:15 < gradius> alexjandro: bingo haha
13:18 < DrItanium> umount /mnt/git <- too lazy to delete the line. Anyway, whether malicious intent was in swing last night is no longer relevant. The bigger fact of the matter is "Does the actions of others in what is, in essence, multiplayer notepad determine your emotions?"
13:19 < airen> Even rainbows is still talking to me.
13:19 < DrItanium> airen: I'm not suprised at all
13:19 < airen> Meh.
13:19 < airen> DrItanium: I've talked to her in private about her issues, because I've had my own health issues.
13:19 < airen> Meh.
13:19 < DrItanium> airen: If I actually thought you were out of line I would have said something to you. I don't think you were at all. I do think zero is
13:19 < gradius> Meh.
13:20 < gradius> That's how this all is. :|
13:20 < DrItanium> NO DON'
13:20 < airen> DrItanium: I don't think zero's out of line.
13:20 < airen> He has his own path to take.
13:20 < DrItanium> Even with the facebook thing?
13:20 < airen> It's an attention thing.
13:20 < airen> I find it funny that he parted with "blah blah grow up something somethign"
13:20 < airen> But then he does something childish.
13:20 < DrItanium> I guess you're right...it is an attention thing. I have had this theory bouncing around the back of my head this entire time about him and I think it's correct.
13:21 < gradius> THEORY NOT PROVED GOD IS REAL STILL
13:21 < gradius> GOSH
13:21 < DrItanium> gradius: Well I can prove that god doesn't exist with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch ;)
13:22 < gradius> That sounds terrible :(
13:22 < DrItanium> gradius: It's meant to be
13:22 < gradius> hahah
13:22 < airen> tl;dr I say dickhole shit, but I'd also pick you up at 03:00 on a Saturday if your car broke down.
13:23 < airen> Also, I think the rage I induced was sexism incarnate.
13:23 < gradius> (he's also into buttsex if you need it)
13:23 < airen> No one says shit when I make fun of swiss or any other male swift member.
13:23 < airen> But when it's about a female people go ballsnuts.
13:23 < gradius> airen: yeah what the hell is that about :|
13:23 < airen> gradius: Sexism.
13:23 < airen> Plain ol' sexism.
13:23 < gradius> Plane of Sexism.
13:24 < gradius> but yeah
13:24 < gradius> wat
13:24 < gradius> IM A BOY I SAVE GIRL
13:24 < DrItanium> airen: Feeling based lifeforms is all I have to say
13:24 < airen> gradius: Basically what it was.
13:24 < airen> I mean, we make fun of mendez and DrItanium having ADHD all the time.
13:24 < airen> That's a fucking learning disability.
13:24 < airen> It's debilitating.
13:25 < gradius> agreed.
13:25 < airen> They've overcome it to some extent with treatment and what not, but no one bats an eye when we make fun of that.
13:25 < DrItanium> airen: I make fun of myself all the time for it :D
13:25 < gradius> but its a funny disability thats why
13:25 < gradius> but dont make fun of girls
13:25 < gradius> thats bad
13:25 < gradius> :|
13:26 < airen> gradius: Essentially.
13:26 < airen> It's sexism.
13:27 < DrItanium> Feeling based organisms
13:28 < airen> Anyway, I think he did it for attention.
13:28 < airen> But then again, maybe I'm just a jerk.
13:29 < DrItanium> airen: If he didn't do it for attention then why the overly long and martyr-esque exit message?
13:29 < airen> DrItanium: His people have a long history of being martyr's
13:30 < DrItanium> HAHAHA
13:30 < DrItanium> Excellent
13:31 < DrItanium> He needs to take a holiday in cambodia
13:31 < gradius> airen: lolololol.
13:34 < alexjandro> airen: really about the car thing? lolol
13:35 < DrItanium> alexjandro: What about cdr?
13:35 < alexjandro> wat
13:35 < alexjandro> i said car
13:35 < DrItanium> And I said cdr
13:35 < alexjandro> fucking adhd man
13:35 < DrItanium> alexjandro: SWING AND A MISS
13:36 < alexjandro> STRIKE ONE
13:36 < DrItanium> But you're right, the synthesis came from me having a very extreme case of ADHD
13:37 < gradius> ha cdr
13:37 < alexjandro> tbh, i THINK i MIGHT have something like that, or im just stupid
13:37 < airen> alexjandro: Something like that.
13:37 < DrItanium> alexjandro: There are two ways to figure this out. We can do the mendez test or the TOVA test.
13:37 < alexjandro> i want both
13:37 < DrItanium> I don't think you have ADHD
13:38 < DrItanium> No you don't!
13:38 < DrItanium> the TOVA test is boring
13:38 < DrItanium> which is the point
13:38 < gradius> I hate boring shit.
13:38 < DrItanium> ^
13:38 < gradius> Also, I really should actually get tested for ADHD :(
13:38 < alexjandro> Well, I know that I'm dyslectic.
13:38 < alexjandro> Sure for
13:38 < DrItanium> alexjandro: lol
13:38 < gradius> Maybe once I get full health coverage w/ Riot.
13:38 < DrItanium> That's smart
13:39 < airen> gradius: Did you get offered a job or not?
13:39 < DrItanium> alexjandro: There are at least 16 types of ADD and ADHD respectively so you may have it but it would be pretty mild
13:40 < alexjandro> oh
13:40 < DrItanium> So there are at least 32 different types across the two spectrums
13:41 < gradius> airen: it's pretty much just paperwork now. Just waiting for the official offer letter + amount.
13:43 < airen> gradius: Best of luck my friend.
13:43 < gradius> Thanks! I'm really hoping that I don't get shafted with the offer.
13:43 < gradius> That's the one thing I'm stressing about, since I don't know what the pay rate is.
13:43 < airen> gradius: I'm seeing some energy presence that tells me you won't.
13:43 < gradius> airen: fuck you
13:43 < gradius> dick
13:43 < airen> gradius: Well, you could come work with me.
13:44 < gradius> airen: yeah, that's what I'm leaning towards if Riot is REALLY bad about how much they're paying
13:44 < airen> gradius: ^_^ We'd have fun.
13:44 < airen> But you'd probably have more fun at Riot.
13:44 < gradius> Yeah, I just have to see.
13:44 < gradius> Because I dont even have the slightest clue what they have to offer me.
13:45 < gradius> but fuck it if its > 60k :(
13:45 < gradius> because like
13:45 < gradius> I've had better verbal offers. :(
13:45 < DrItanium> If it's greater than 60k?
13:45 < gradius> err
13:45 < gradius> did I typo that?

13:47 < gradius> like many people have said before
13:47 < gradius> you better get a job there
13:47 < gradius> or NVIDIA is retarded
13:47 < timmah> gradius: send me that info ffs
13:47 < DrItanium> They put me on hold
13:47 < gradius> timmah: FUCK YOU I DONT WANT YOU ANY MROE
13:47 < DrItanium> Since i wasn't done with my thesis

13:48 < mendez> SO FULL OF FEELS
13:48 < alexjandro> Hey guys can I go work with you? probro yells too much
13:48 < mendez> WHY CAN'T I HOLD ALL THESE FEELS
13:48 < airen> alexjandro: You wouldn't like my job.

13:49 < mendez> alexjandro: you'd need to be smart to do my job

13:50 < mendez> alexjandro: you're not retarded, you're just not the right person for what i do
13:51 < gradius> mendez: don't give him too much credit.
13:51 < gradius> :P
13:51 < alexjandro> None taken
13:51 < DrItanium> What about code scheduling?
13:52  * DrItanium likes static code scheduling a little too much
13:52 < mendez> gradius: i have to agree that #testgradius has been better then #swift for a while
13:52 < mendez> also no tubig here
13:52 < DrItanium> I'd like a scoop of NP-Complete ontop of that code schedule ice cream cone
13:53 < DrItanium> mendez: This is true, tubig is an asshole who picks fights :(
13:54 < mendez> DrItanium: i mostly enjoy watching him hit on swiss, zero, and all the other babbys
13:54 < gradius> tubig is awkward too :(
13:54 < alexjandro> who is tubig?
13:54 < mendez> tubig's not a bad guy but awkward as fuck
13:54 < alexjandro> and i hit on swiss a lot
13:54 < mendez> gay dude who was trying to bang gradius a while back
13:54 < DrItanium> So awkward that was
13:55 < alexjandro> whoa
13:55 < alexjandro> like, for real?
13:56 < DrItanium> alexjandro: We've said some strange crap across these years but this is dead fucking true
13:58 < DrItanium> Nuclear Waffles EVERYWHERE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD ENJOY IT
13:58 < DrItanium> Too bad there isn't mid capitalization
13:58 < DrItanium> Then I could do SDR captialization across words
13:59 < DrItanium> Although it would be more analog than digital
13:59 < DrItanium> Fuck it approximate it
14:00 < DrItanium> I mean we do it with audio, so why not in this aspect as well?
14:20 < alexjandro> wat
14:22 < alexjandro> Well, I could see where he is coming from.
14:23 < hotdogs> what
14:23 < alexjandro> hotdogs: you have charter?
14:23 < hotdogs> No
14:23 < alexjandro> oh, what do you have?
14:23 < alexjandro> and how much are you paying?
14:23 < prometheusx> ours i pretty expensive i think
14:24 < hotdogs> 30/5
14:24 < hotdogs> $80 or so
14:24 < hotdogs> not on 12 month deal or anything
14:24 < alexjandro> hotdogs: WHO
14:24 < hotdogs> TWC
14:24 < alexjandro> oh
14:25 < hotdogs> does it matter who? it's not charter
14:25 < hotdogs> I get my internet from fucking unicorns
14:25  * mendez made the mistake of getting dsl
14:25 < hotdogs> shoulda gone with unicorns
14:26 < alexjandro> hmmm so $30/month for 12 months for 30/4 or 5. hmmm
14:26 < prometheusx> hotdogs: https://micahblackburn.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/dropbears1.jpg
14:27 < alexjandro> it would be better than the 3/768k that we have now that is like $50
14:27 < alexjandro> fuck verizon
14:28 < alexjandro> hotdogs: are you just not on contract just because you don't like being tied down to "the man"
14:31 < hotdogs> prometheusx: wat
14:31 < hotdogs> what contracts?
14:32 < hotdogs> I meant the 12 month deals they do that they advertise to get you in
14:33 < alexjandro> oh, then you get stuck with a higer price after
14:34 < prometheusx> hotdogs: dropbears! warn catears
14:54 < hotdogs> alexjandro: no, I've changed my service multiple times since the first year
14:54 < hotdogs> but I haven't bothered whining to get a discount or anything
14:54 < timmah> hotdogs: wateR?
14:55 < hotdogs> for example, zero heard my monthly bill and was like "what? I only pay $30" but he's on the discounted price
14:56 < alexjandro> yea, sucks for him if he moved out and had to cancel the contract
14:59 < hotdogs> timmah: I don't really need any but okay I guess
15:03 < timmah> hotdogs: hooray
15:04 < hotdogs> timmah: lobby?
15:06 < alexjandro> hotdogs: stop by the 4th floor and see if my zune is in the lab?
15:45 < alexjandro> kthanks
16:08 < alexjandro> swiss: racecar?
16:08 < alexjandro> oh wait, I can't today, i need new tires
16:10 < prometheusx> OH GOD!
16:43 < mendez> alexjandro: irl racecar?
16:49 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: no bitching, no talking about other irc channels, no feels.
17:11 < alexjandro> mendez: well when I take my car to the racetrack i call it a racecar
17:19 < hotdogs> I liked the last topic better
17:20 < alexjandro> yea me too
17:20 < alexjandro> now we can we bitch about not being able to bitch
17:21 < prometheusx> gradius: YOU CAN'T TAKE MY BITCHING AWAY FROM ME
17:22 < hotdogs> I HATE #SWIFT
17:22 < hotdogs> HOW DO YOU FEEL
17:23 < prometheusx> TIRED
17:23 < prometheusx> I FEEL TIRED AND SORE
17:24 < hotdogs> THAT IS UNFORTUNATE
17:24 < hotdogs> DO YOU REQUIRE RUBBING?
17:26 < airen> ISN'T THAT WHY HE'S SORE?
17:27 < prometheusx> YES, I NEED RUBBING
17:27 < prometheusx> ON MY INNER THIGH
17:31 < swiss> alexjandro: my tripmeater just went out :/
17:35  * swiss actually read a lot of that backlog
17:35 < swiss> good discussion was had
17:35 < swiss> this is why I like #testgradius
17:35 < swiss> gradius: <3
17:36 < hotdogs> fuck you
17:37 < swiss> zero hasn't started IRC back up
18:06 < mendez> alexjandro: <3
18:07 < mendez> swiss: moar like babby zero-fun
18:09 < alexjandro> mendez: racecar with a roofrack
18:10 < alexjandro> swiss: you don't need that
18:10 < alexjandro> swiss: my odometer had't worked for like 10 years
18:11 < swiss> alexjandro: it's how i tell how much gas I have left htough!
18:12 < alexjandro> fill it up before you leave, fill it up on the way home. You always brag about <40 mpg
18:12 < alexjandro> also, you don't need a trip, just use the total one
18:13 < swiss> mendez: he texted me though today, but 100% unrelated
18:13 < swiss> he said "No fiber here, looks like we'll have to bend over for time warner"
18:19 < prometheusx> gradius: girldius should have a feature of randomly kicking and then oping people when they return for a game of zombieops!
19:46 < chrislz> wow
19:50 < chrislz> i sure missed the drama
19:50 < chrislz> airen: DrItanium: alexjandro: swiss: you guys are pretty fucked up
19:51 < hotdogs> chrislz: YOU ALSO MISSED YOUR PAPERS
19:52 < chrislz> hotdogs: don't need them
19:55 < chrislz> i am srsly disappoint
20:08 < drboots> That awkward moment where you're wondering if this is a guys name or a program service/app.

10:55 < hotdogs> like throwing greatswords
10:55 < timmah> hahaha
10:56 < timmah> I think I'm going to stick to rifles
10:56 < timmah> I would love to dual wield pistols
10:57 < timmah> but the dps/utility of rifles is higher
10:57 < timmah> honestly, my only complaint is they throw too much at you in the beginning
10:58 < hotdogs> yes
10:59 < timmah> http://i.imgur.com/oeqTY.gif
10:59 < timmah> that was me

11:13 < timmah> Hell yes
11:13 < hotdogs> FAPFAPFAP
11:14 < timmah> SUPER NOOB SQUAD HOO
11:14 < gradius> You just have to choose to "rep" the one that you wanna use chat with and stuff
11:14 < gradius> Makes sense though, since the name of the game IS guild wars.
11:14 < timmah> rep?
11:14 < timmah> oh

11:14 < timmah> right

11:14 < timmah> yeah, it took a while to install
11:14 < gradius> you're right though
11:14 < gradius> there's SO much to do.
11:14 < gradius> also, my client kept dc'ing last night :(
11:15 < timmah> I like that there's daily chest stuff
11:15 < timmah> so even if you only have an hour or so, you can still get stuff
11:15 < hotdogs> gradius: I am a pirate
11:15 < hotdogs> I got (well, malaphax did) the pirate chest piece
11:15 < hotdogs> and a yellow pistol
11:16 < hotdogs> DUAL PISTOLS PEW PEW PEW PEW PEW
11:16 < airen> ack
11:16 < hotdogs> also, hit 40 last night
11:16 < timmah> gradius: what level are you?
11:16 < gradius> 6 on my theif.
11:17 < gradius> after I had to remake b/c of disconnect issues :(
11:17 < timmah> right right
11:17 < timmah> I ended up making an asura engineer
11:17 < hotdogs> gradius: YOU COPYING ME BRO
11:17 < timmah> gradius: dude, you should get on mumble
11:17 < timmah> with us when we play
11:17 < gradius> hotdogs: THIEF IS FUN
11:17 < gradius> timmah: that sounds good to me.
11:17 < hotdogs> SO YOU'RE COPYING ME
11:17 < gradius> YES
11:17 < gradius> :D
11:17 < hotdogs> I almost did warrior but then everyone I was playing with did warrior
11:18 < hotdogs> gradius: we should do wvw with you on mumble, then we can make sure big groups of people smash together
11:18 < timmah> dude yes.
11:19 < gradius> that'd be awesome
11:19 < hotdogs> and then I can murder rioters
11:19 < hotdogs> INGAME.  INGAME.  INGAME.
11:19 < timmah> hotdogs: would that make us "The Man"
11:20 < hotdogs> oh man
11:21 < timmah> SHIT OKAY
11:22 < timmah> I got that itch man
11:22 < gradius> hahahaha
11:24 < hotdogs> I have to figure out where catears is playing as well
11:25 < gradius> aww yea
11:28 < hotdogs> and trade gear for nude pics
11:28 < alexjandro> hotdogs: its free if you just take it
11:29 < timmah> hotdogs: ever figure out where the gold gun came from?
11:29 < hotdogs> gun or bow?
11:29 < hotdogs> gun: nigel got it as a drop and gave it to me
11:29 < hotdogs> bow: some random mailed nigel a gold bow
11:30 < hotdogs> this is why you always right click -> mail
11:30 < gradius> lolol nbice
11:30 < timmah> the bow
11:30 < timmah> oh okay
11:30 < hotdogs> I don't think he mailed them back
11:30 < timmah> lol
11:30 < hotdogs> I think it would be best not to say anything
11:30 < hotdogs> cause I don't think there's a sent box
11:31 < hotdogs> so they have no idea who they actually sent it to
11:31 < timmah> I was reading about comp'd accounts on the subreddit
11:31 < hotdogs> already? dayum
11:31 < timmah> yep.
11:31 < timmah> wtb 2-factor auth plz thanks
11:32 < hotdogs> NO.
11:32 < hotdogs> I wonder if it's because people are owned and they click save password
11:32  * hotdogs has his password saved
11:32 < hotdogs> OH NOOOOO
11:33 < timmah> Some theories are that it's mainly on accounts that have an associated battle.net acct
11:33 < timmah> since bnet got cracked a while back
11:33 < hotdogs> do they use emails as account names?
11:33 < timmah> you can, yes
11:33 < hotdogs> I guess they'll have the email anyway
11:33 < gradius> yup
11:33 < timmah> and you can know if an e-mail is valid or not instantly
14:34 < timmah> gradius: I WANT MY PRESENTER BACK

09:45 < gradius> for the actual thread.
09:45 < gradius> though it was on frontpage
09:45 < gradius> so you all likely have seen it :(
09:48 < timmah> shit
09:48 < timmah> the smoothie place cant take card tiday
09:48 < timmah> today os a bad day
09:51 < gradius> :(
09:52 < hotdogs> timmah: you're getting a smoothie too?
09:52 < hotdogs> oh lol
09:52 < hotdogs> also, I can tell timmah was using hacker keyboard
09:53 < hotdogs> gradius: if you log in, your front page depends on your subs
09:53 < hotdogs> so...that's not on my frontpage!
09:56 < timmah> hotdogs: actually I wasn't
09:56 < timmah> I was going to get a smoothie but their card system is down. I thought it a good replacement for a meal
09:56 < timmah> and my fingers are just fat and lazy
09:57 < timmah> otherwise I could have tab-completed alexjandro's name
09:57 < hotdogs> Oh
09:57 < hotdogs> I meant all the typos earlier
10:01 < timmah> yeah, still the same keyboard
10:01 < timmah> I was just lazy
10:01 < timmah> and connectbot sucks for seeing what you're typing
10:17 < hotdogs> I see

10:53 < gradius> and I'd hate to miss it :(
10:53 < gradius> but am hungry
10:54 < airen> gradius: Standups are short.

10:57 < timmah> gradius: let us know when your standup is finished
10:57 < gradius> well we usually have it around 11:30
10:57 < gradius> that's the problem
10:58 < timmah> when is it over?
10:58 < timmah> because we can eat at 12:30-13
10:58 < gradius> we're almost always done in about 20 min
11:00 < timmah> then not a problem this time

16:17 < timmah> hotdogs: well that was interesting
16:21 < prometheusx> timmah: WHAT WAS!
16:24 < timmah> prometheusx: people
16:24 < timmah> prometheusx: hotdogs: bowlan?
16:25 < timmah> gradius: bowlan?
16:27 < prometheusx> timmah: what time?
16:28 < timmah> 8:30
16:28 < timmah> earlier if you want to buy shoes
16:33 < prometheusx> nah, at workage, probably won't get home till about 8
16:36 < timmah> prometheusx: rgr should have seen if my shoes fit you
16:36 < timmah> still going though?
16:36 < timmah> I might go early and inquire about ordering a ball
16:36 < timmah> bowling.reddit.com has some good suggestions
16:37 < swiss> timmah: if you do we should wax up the telecom lab and bowl in tthere :P
16:37 < prometheusx> swiss: he did by a box of 10 pins
16:38 < timmah> prometheusx: this is true
16:38 < timmah> swiss: I'd need more length though
16:38 < prometheusx> that's what she said
16:38 < timmah> if I could roll it up the wall, have it curve around, then come down the other side
16:38 < timmah> that'd be about right
16:38 < swiss> like a bombchu
16:39 < timmah> pretty much
16:41 < mendez> WHY WAS BOMBCHU NEVER A POKEMON
16:41 < mendez> ;_;
17:00 < drboots> Probably because its only move would be run and explode?
17:01 < swiss> isn't that all that voltorb did?
17:01 < swiss> except without the running?
17:03 < mendez> drboots: they could had had the kamakzi from serious sam then too!
17:04 < prometheusx> wasn't voltorb also an electric type?
17:05 < timmah> yes
17:06 < drboots> mendez: lol'in
17:11 < drboots> Stupid question
17:11 < drboots> But I just got asked this for a phone interview oddly enough
17:11 < drboots> When the primary drive in a RAID1 fails, can you plug that drive into another server and boot off of it?
17:12 < drboots> Ive never had a RAID fail on me before
17:16 < timmah> drboots: raid 1 is mirror. answer was yes.
17:17 < timmah> I've had my raid1 break before, it's slightly annoying
17:17 < drboots> Good, thats what I said, but the guy kind of gaveme a weird response to it
17:17 < timmah> what did he say?
17:18 < drboots> He says "Uh...okay, moving on"
17:19 < prometheusx> the fails makes me think the hard drive physically failed
17:20 < drboots> Yeah, physical primary drive failure
17:21 < timmah> wait
17:21 < timmah> I didn't catch the wording
17:21 < timmah> THAT DRIVE
17:21 < drboots> Sorry, meant the othe rdrive
17:21 < drboots> The secondary
17:22 < timmah> if the primary drive fails in a RAID1, you can use the other drive
17:22 < hotdogs> chrislz: that song is stuck in my head, I hate you
17:22 < drboots> Alright, good.  Seems I conquered that interview

09:07 < timmah> hotdogs: saw that when it was OC
09:16 < hotdogs> big man
09:16 < hotdogs> timmah: did you go bowling yesterday
09:21 < timmah> no, worked on my desktops instead
09:22 < timmah> I finished them this morning, so I should be golden.
09:29 < hotdogs> so sysprep worked?
09:31 < timmah> funny story about that
09:31 < timmah> The overarching answer is "yes"
09:32 < hotdogs> wat
09:32 < timmah> I kept getting this message
09:32 < timmah> http://benjamio.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/sysprepError.png
09:33 < timmah> and so I kept rebooting
09:33 < timmah> one website said to look at logs for registry errors
09:33 < timmah> but I basically ended up restarting ~5+ times and then, it just worked.
09:33 < alexjandro> lol
09:33 < timmah> so I'm wondering if each time it rebooted, it fixed an issue and another came up
09:34 < hotdogs> fun
09:34 < hotdogs> I wonder what will be broken in the future from this
09:34 < timmah> I don't know, but all that sysprep did was generalize the drivers afaik
09:34 < hotdogs> that's always what I wonder when I do hokey things with windows
09:35 < timmah> I always expect the worst
09:35 < timmah> so I was prepared to do a full reinstall
09:35 < timmah> or a disk recovery
10:55 < hotdogs> zero-one: are you alive this week
10:57 < zero-one> hotdogs: I am.

16:48 < zero-one> gradius: i'm going to find something for it to do
16:48 < hotdogs> hardware failure isn't really in scope for ccdc
16:48 < zero-one> i just don't know what yet
16:48 < alexjandro> Means it will get "dropped"
16:48 < timmah> hotdogs: He als oprobably couldn't move it
16:48 < gradius> hotdogs: I dont think it was for CCDC, he just mentioned he was itnerested in it
16:48 < alexjandro> zero-one: Install slowaris
16:48 < hotdogs> gradius: nooooooooo
16:48 < alexjandro> and learn it
16:48 < zero-one> gradius: i might use it at home for something simple
16:49 < hotdogs> I thought about taking the hard drives out, just to make it even more of a turd
16:49 < hotdogs> zero-one: hope you like something loud and hot
16:49 < hotdogs> and slow as fuck
16:49 < hotdogs> like, irssi-is-laggy slow as fuck
16:49 < zero-one> hotdogs: NOOOOO

16:49 < alexjandro> whoa it has 2 HDMI next to the dual gig ethernet http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Sun_SparcStation_10_back.jpg
16:50 < hotdogs> "The SS10 holds system information such as MAC address and serial number in NVRAM. If the battery on this chip dies, then the system will not be able to boot."
16:50 < zero-one> lolol

16:51 < hotdogs> FUCK
16:51 < hotdogs> "Wait, why do you have two gig ethernets?" -alexjandro during lovemaking

20:04 < alexjandro> DrItanium: "One of the easiest ways to improve processor performances is by exploiting instruction level parallelism through the inclusion of multiple execution units. Each execution unit is capable of executing an instruction. By identifying and dispatching independent instructions it is possible to execute multiple instrucions per cycle. The act of identification and dispatch, also known as scheduling, can be performed dynamically or statically

13:44 < hotdogs> you can't send anything to the ok prompt?
13:45 < zero-one> hotdogs: nope :(
13:46 < zero-one> unless i'm misconfigured or something that i don't understand
13:48 < hotdogs> dunno
13:48 < hotdogs> if you can see the prompt then you should be able to type to it

06:35 < swiss> Fucccck me.
06:36 < swiss> and I couldn't do it after the paint gets fixed, cause there's a high chance at scratching the paint when routing cables through the front end of the car...
06:37 < swiss> I just spend the last 7-8 hours rewiring the front end of my car
06:38 < swiss> cause my dad told me last night that he's getting the paint fixed on my car in the morning
06:38 < swiss> and the wiring was fucked up a bit, but it might scratch the paintjob when i work
06:38 < swiss> did *not* want to do that really
07:19 < alexjandro> wat
07:21 < alexjandro> haha i remember when I moved my battery to the trunk and took out the shitty alarm that the previous owner put in and cleaned all the grounds, all the lights were brighter and the radio sounded better.
07:21 < alexjandro> then I derped and ran new speaker cables to the back along side the battery cable
11:22 < swiss> yeah... the hard part about this was i wanted these cables secured within the bodywork every foot or so
11:22 < swiss> and i wanted zip ties to do it
11:23 < swiss> but the body didn't have any holes big enough to stick my hand in. I ended up running twine in the hole, to the end, then around the wire, and it was just a general pita
11:23 < swiss> each zip tie would take me an hour and a half to two hours to get in
11:24 < swiss> i only put 3 in for the wires i did cause it was so hard
11:25 < alexjandro> haha
11:25 < alexjandro> Im sure you have a lot more wiring than me
11:43 < hotdogs> every foot? dayum
14:31 < swiss> hotdogs: it only travels inside the body for 3-4 feet at a time
14:31 < swiss> but lots of sharp metal edges inside
14:31 < swiss> also, wrapping any possible rub points in electrical tape/ 20 mil PVC tape
15:04 < mendez> gradius: in a project i'm working says "Unable to comply, building in progress!" whenever you call an unimplemented method :P
15:22 < hotdogs> timmah: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSep7QJXKlE
15:22 < timmah> oh that was the song
15:22 < hotdogs> it was a cover there
15:22 < hotdogs> but the original is so much better
15:24 < timmah> rgr
15:31 < hotdogs> god, the youtube comments

16:00 < mendez> gradius: running from the po po
16:01 < alexjandro> gradius: what the fuck
16:01 < alexjandro> my head hurts
16:01 < alexjandro> after looking at that pic
16:05 < DrItanium> lol Asus' service website has triggered NoScript's clickjacking protection twice. First was the "enter your product field" the second was a minus symbol for SATA drivers for my motherboard
16:09 < gradius> wow
16:09 < gradius> nice Asus.

16:33 < swiss> but I'm NOT
16:34 < alexjandro> yes you are
16:34 < alexjandro> the computer never lies
16:35 < swiss> >:O
16:35 < alexjandro> let me see
16:35 < swiss> my super fun script is almost done
16:35 < alexjandro> the code
16:37 < swiss> one sec
16:37 < swiss> stupid clipboard....
16:38 < gradius> swiss: you're not a coder.
16:38 < gradius> stop trying.
16:38 < gradius> go back to making electronics and driving bad cars.
16:38 < gradius> :D
16:38 < gradius> (obv I'm joking bb)
16:38 < gradius> <3
16:39 < swiss> gradius: it's scripting, not coding :P
16:39 < swiss> http://pastebin.com/PK5MSisY
16:39 < swiss> that's just the function it's complaining about
16:39 < alexjandro> I CAN CODE SCRIPTS
16:40 < alexjandro> swiss: doesn't give you a line #?
16:40 < alexjandro> swiss: maybe it doesn't like that call in the middle
16:41 < zero-one> alexjandro: i can program html
16:41 < alexjandro> dude me too@
16:41 < gradius> zero-one: no bad
16:41 < alexjandro> can you do css?
16:41 < hotdogs> scripting in a turing complete language == programming
16:41 < zero-one> i made a game in CSS
16:41 < gradius> hotdogs: your mom is turing complete!
16:41 < hotdogs> probably
16:41 < alexjandro> duuude css is my favorite Valve game!
16:41 < gradius> swiss: are any of the other functions your calling giving that error?
16:42 < gradius> or is it the one you posted?
16:42 < swiss> gradius: no, its that one
16:42 < gradius> what's the error?
16:42 < alexjandro> no line numbers
16:42 < alexjandro> in the error
16:42 < swiss> so the error just randomly stopped happening
16:42 < gradius> :|
16:42 < alexjandro> haha its the magic tech support fix
16:42 < alexjandro> have someone else look at the issue and it goes away
16:42 < swiss> and it was claiming line 37 of file, which was the else after s:getchar()
16:43 < gradius> PEBKAC
16:43 < alexjandro> wat
16:43 < swiss> gradius: wut
16:43 < timmah> WOT

16:50 < alexjandro> gradius: as airen said a few days ago, It's  Layer 8 issue.
16:50 < alexjandro> It's a*
16:52 < alexjandro> swiss: you should come to the imports meet
16:52 < alexjandro> ill buy you In-N-Out
16:57 < swiss> alexjandro: lol
16:57 < alexjandro> i really will
16:57 < alexjandro> and i won't try to bang you
17:05 < gradius> He'd okay it if you DID try to bang him
17:06 < swiss> gradius: don't make me sound easy!
17:12 < gradius> You're not.
17:12 < gradius> I just know I would like alexjandro to.
17:12 < gradius> So I'm just helping you out
17:20 < alexjandro> wat
17:21 < alexjandro> swiss: so you better leave now
17:34 < hotdogs> "hey guys, I'm getting an error. let me upload a version of the code that doesn't contain it"
17:58 < swiss> lol
17:59 < swiss> hotdogs: that's what was causing the error according to the script
17:59 < swiss> it said the function name and line number
18:15 < hotdogs> but then you said you ran it again and it didn't error
18:37 < swiss> yeah. a bunch of fuckery in vim scripting
18:58 < alexjandro> whoops. that was too long of a nap
19:09 < swiss> alexjandro: my body won't sleep recently :(
19:13 < alexjandro> :( need to go run around outside till you pass out
19:13 < alexjandro> swiss: I was GOING to go, then I decided to take a quick nap, and now im 15 minutes late
19:13 < alexjandro> not gonna go anymore
19:13 < alexjandro> lol
19:15 < swiss> alexjandro: everyone shows up at least half an hour late during the school year
19:15 < swiss> i have no idea about the summer
19:15 < alexjandro> oh well
19:15 < alexjandro> im still sleeping
19:15 < swiss> i'm jealous
19:16 < swiss> alexjandro: I'm not allowed to exercise for fear of death
19:19 < alexjandro> still
19:19 < alexjandro> why?
19:19 < alexjandro> and for how long?
19:21 < swiss> because i'm not allowed to raise my blood pressure for at least a week
19:21 < alexjandro> from the surgury?
19:22 < alexjandro> swiss: not like you have a job or school yet, so you don't need to worry about sleep
19:23 < swiss> alexjandro: still not healthy when you're up for 44 hours and you body sleeps for 8, then is up for another 30 and only sleeps for 4
19:23 < swiss> I'm kinda concerned
19:24 < alexjandro> sounds like airen problems
19:24 < alexjandro> did it start after the surgury?
19:25 < swiss> alexjandro: yes, but I don't know if it's related
19:26 < alexjandro> go back to the doctor
19:26 < swiss> fuckthat
19:26 < alexjandro> then stop complaining
19:26 < swiss> i'm too tired to leave the house
19:26 < swiss> but my body won't sleep
19:27 < alexjandro> sounds like ther perfect invitation for rape
19:42 < swiss> will it help me sleep?
19:48 < alexjandro> no, it might kill you when your heart rate goes up
19:54 < swiss> lol
19:54 < swiss> also, sneezing might kill me
19:54 < swiss> from sudden blood loss :/
19:56 < alexjandro> haha
19:56 < alexjandro> but now that I think about it, the first time would be filled with mass confusion and frustration
19:56 < alexjandro> so you probably wouldn't get your blood pressure up too hihg
19:56 < alexjandro> high
19:57 < swiss> who says it'd be my first time
20:03 < alexjandro> with a guy?
20:04 < swiss> getting raped
20:05 < alexjandro> Wait so you can lead
20:05 < alexjandro> Right? Don't they take turns in rape?
20:06 < swiss> well, have you passed you rape test yet?
20:06 < swiss> I have a class C rape license
20:06 < alexjandro> no i have not
20:07 < alexjandro> where do I take it
20:07 < alexjandro> and how do I study?
20:14 < airen> swiss: Vicodin can cause insomnia.
20:14 < swiss> airen: I haven't taken it since saturday
20:16 < airen> Your system has had quite a shock though.
20:16 < airen> swiss: Try melatonin, it can help regulate your sleep a bit.
20:16 < swiss> i should
20:17 < swiss> too lazy/tired to go to store though :P
20:17 < swiss> if I have issues tomorrow I'll do it though
20:17 < alexjandro> "GUYS IM TIRED"
20:17 < alexjandro> Go to bed
20:17 < alexjandro> "I CAN'T"
20:17 < alexjandro> Try X
20:18 < alexjandro> "BUT IM TOO TIRED TO GO TO THE STORE"
20:18 < alexjandro> Well, fuck off
20:18 < swiss> alexjandro: but I like complaining!
20:18 < swiss> and it doesn't take any effort
20:19 < alexjandro> I know what you mean
20:23 < airen> Being tired != being able to sleep
20:23 < airen> swiss: I didn't mean tonight, I mean soon.
20:25 < alexjandro> airen: So kinda like being physically tired but mentally awake?
20:25 < swiss> on the plus side, i've gotten good at vim......
20:27 < airen> alexjandro: Kinda.
20:27 < airen> But insomnia is an awful thing.
20:32 < swiss> when i started working on my car last night I was actually tired
20:32 < swiss> and could have fallen asleep
20:33 < swiss> however, when i finished 8 hours later, i only slept for 4 hours?
20:33 < swiss> felt so wrong
20:33 < airen> I know this feel.
20:33 < alexjandro> Maybe because it was you were doing something you like?
20:34 < swiss> alexjandro: i didn't want to to do it though
20:34 < swiss> and then the paint guy today didn't get the paint in time
20:34 < swiss> and he's doing it monday
20:34 < swiss> so it was all worthless
20:34 < swiss> I'd say I'm really pissed about it, but I'm too tired to be pissed
20:35 < alexjandro> But did you enjoy what you were doing even though you didn't want to
20:36 < swiss> not really
20:36 < swiss> i was cursing most of the time that i did it
20:36 < swiss> and when the sprinklers turned on it sucked even more
20:36 < swiss> and i learned what the van that delivers the paper looks like
20:36 < swiss> and he missed me by around 5 inches when he threw the paper
20:37 < alexjandro> should have thrown it back
20:38 < swiss> well, i didn't realize that's what it was at first
20:38 < swiss> I actually dove behind my car when it happened to take protection from whoever was throwing things at mea
20:38 < swiss> I immediately thought it was drunk teenagers and they were throwing shit out the windows
20:43 < alexjandro> haha

22:47 < swiss> hotdogs: because irssi insists on putting the things put on the line that are after the command at the END of the command
22:47 < swiss> and tr, without a file, doesn't like accepting input written after it
22:48 < airen> swiss: Redirects don't work?
22:48 < swiss> airen: you mean $@?
22:48 < swiss> or what
22:48 < airen> swiss: I mean <
22:48 < swiss> oh, i don't know any of those that go from a string except heredoc styled
22:48 < swiss> and that won't do it
22:52 < swiss> maybe I need to find a new command to do it with instead of tr
22:52 < alexjandro> I hate vimtutor
22:53 < alexjandro> worst game ever
22:53 < swiss> alexjandro: lololololol
22:56 < alexjandro> I mean, I know how to insert and save and move around with the arrow keys. It's just using hjkl, my has is like "NOPE THIS FEELS WRONG"
22:56 < airen> alexjandro: lololol
22:56 < alexjandro> my hand*
22:58 < swiss> alexjandro: it feels so much nicer for me now though
22:59 < swiss> protip: imap jj <Esc>
22:59 < swiss> cause how many words do you use that have two js in them?
22:59 < alexjandro> Also, from my "outsiders" point of view. I think j and k should be reversed. so it's up/down, not down/up
22:59 < swiss> then you don't have to take you hands off the homerow to get out of insert
22:59 < swiss> alexjandro: you use down more than up, and your right pointer finger (much stronger, doesn't get tired as fast) sits on down
23:00 < swiss> down is probably your most used key when navigating a file, so it's mapped to j
23:00 < alexjandro> SHUT THE FUCK UP
23:01 < alexjandro> YOUR LOGIC IS STUPID BECAUSE I DON"T LIKE IT
23:01 < alexjandro> also, how the fuck did I manage to split my screen
23:01 < alexjandro> FUCK
23:01 < swiss> lol, holding shift, not using caps lock
23:01 < swiss> alexjandro: with :split ?
23:01 < swiss> or :window
23:02 < swiss> hmm, it wouldn't be window, nvm
23:02 < swiss> I don't like splits, I just use tabs
23:02 < alexjandro> Also, I can't use ctrl + a , a to switch between chrome and putty :|
23:02 < airen> swiss: Splits are great.
23:03 < swiss> airen: also, tiny screen
23:03 < alexjandro> There, it went away with ctrl + a , Q
23:03 < swiss> alexjandro: lolwut
23:03 < alexjandro> http://superuser.com/questions/243459/unix-how-to-unsplit-in-screen
23:03 < airen> alexjandro: aka man screen
23:04 < swiss> also, since using vim, I have (multiple times) tried to search a webpage using / followed by regex
23:04 < alexjandro> haha
23:04 < airen> swiss: PENTADACTYL
23:04 < airen> DO IT
23:04 < airen> Because you can
23:04 < swiss> airen: but but
23:04 < swiss> how will i make fun of zero-one for using it if I use it?
23:04 < airen> swiss: Mendez and I use it (lol i started it)
23:04 < airen> And rinon uses it too
23:05 < alexjandro> swiss: You need to do it if you really want to be on the linux team
23:05 < swiss> yeah, but you're just being linux elitist (at least, that's my current way of making fun of it)
23:05 < alexjandro> Its a pre-req
23:05 < swiss> lol
23:05 < swiss> welp, guess I'm not linux team. :P
23:06 < alexjandro> haha
23:06 < airen> swiss: Nope, it's about making your browser workflow more effcient.
23:06 < swiss> airen: and being a linux elitist :P
23:06 < swiss> but I might do it on my laptop........
23:06 < alexjandro> swiss: WHY DOES YOU LOGIC ABOUT JK MAKE SENSE NOW THAT I THINK OF IT LIKE THAT
23:06 < airen> It doesn't.
23:07 < swiss> airen: my logic about j and k?
23:07 < alexjandro> moving in vim
23:07 < swiss> i think it does.
23:07 < alexjandro> it does
23:07 < alexjandro> thats why im mad
23:07 < swiss> when you want to go down you'd rather tap your pointer finger than your middle finger
23:07 < swiss> alexjandro: it all makes sense when you start thinking about how it was designed for speed
23:07 < alexjandro> But if I want to scroll fast then I just hold it down...
23:08 < swiss> alexjandro: also, start using numbers
23:08 < alexjandro> and at that point it doesn't usually matter
23:08 < swiss> 20j
23:08 < swiss> then tap . to repeat that 20j
23:08 < alexjandro> jump 20 lines?
23:08 < swiss> it means 20 * the keypress
23:08 < swiss> so 20 * j, which brings you down one line
23:08 < swiss> then . means repeat last command
23:08 < swiss> that's how you scroll fast
23:09 < swiss> hmm, . doesn't work with that
23:09 < swiss> nvm
23:09 < airen> Or you could ^d
23:09 < swiss> airen: the control key is so far away though!
23:09 < alexjandro> what is this black magic
23:10 < swiss> and the right ctrl is night useless on this keyboard
23:10 < airen> or you can ^f
23:10 < swiss> alexjandro: just don't hit shfit+k
23:10 < airen> ^u to go up (or ^b)
23:11 < airen> swiss: K is really useful for bash scripts.
23:11 < alexjandro> swiss: now i want to
23:11 < swiss> airen: but it's fucking annoying any other time
23:11 < airen> >knowing whta you're doing
23:11 < swiss> I want shift + k to pgdown
23:11 < swiss> and shift j to pageup
23:11 < swiss> i might remap them
23:12 < airen> swiss: If you're going to customize this much, you may as well be using emacs.
23:12 < swiss> i mean, shift E is open
23:12 < swiss> why now shift + E to execute
23:12 < airen> wut
23:12 < airen> E is end of word
23:14 < swiss> isn't e (not shift+e) end of word as well
23:15 < airen> Yeah.
23:15 < airen> It's more that E isn't defined.
23:15 < airen> but you made it execute?
23:16 < swiss> i could
23:16 < swiss> and I think I will
23:17 < swiss> oh wait
23:17 < swiss> E is different from e
23:17 < swiss> like W from w
23:17 < swiss> (changes how the word is definined)
23:18 < swiss> or I could do Ex as a map
23:18 < swiss> i mean, i just don't see myself using it often enough to dictate it being a home row key
23:20 < alexjandro> haha why does my wrist hurt now from having my hands on hjkl
23:20 < airen> alexjandro: because you're new to touch typing?
23:22 < swiss> alexjandro: why are your fingers on hjkl
23:22 < swiss> that's weird
23:22 < swiss> jkl;
23:22 < swiss> that's the correct way
23:23 < alexjandro> swiss: yea but im moving up and down in the tutor, so i have to shift my hand over to the right every time I want to move?
23:23 < alexjandro> airen: i think its cause its usually on a mouse :|
23:23 < airen> alexjandro: Touching th emouse is bad.
23:24 < alexjandro> IM SORRY I GREW UP WRING
23:24 < alexjandro> WRONG
23:24 < swiss> alexjandro: just one finger
23:24 < swiss> how many times do you need to move left?
23:24 < swiss> also, use b more
23:25 < swiss> airen: i enabled the mouse in im :<
23:25 < swiss> vim*
23:25 < swiss> \
23:25 < alexjandro> WAIT I CAN USE A MOUSE IN VIM
23:25 < airen> lololol
23:25 < zero-one> alexjandro: no, he's just making it all up
23:25 < zero-one> swiss: stop it with your dirty lies
23:26 < alexjandro> zero-one: :( okay
23:26 < airen> alexjandro: Yes you can, but you lose a lot of functionality that way.
23:27 < swiss> zero-one: which dirty lies?
23:27 < swiss> alexjandro: set mouse=a
23:27 < swiss> >:D
23:27 < airen> alexjandro: are you using vim or gvim?
23:27 < alexjandro> vim
23:28 < swiss> airen: i don't have gvim
23:28 < swiss> mouse works perfectly in it though
23:28 < airen> swiss: Me either.
23:28 < airen> swiss: I know.
23:34 < airen> swiss: Ahead of you in mango again.
23:34 < airen> Suck it bitch
23:34 < swiss> WELL
23:34 < swiss> i'll have to fix that later
23:34 < swiss> i'll just catch up on sekirei, it cheats the system :P
23:35 < swiss> chapters are super short QQ
23:53 < swiss> so C-Space is producing C-@ for some reason
23:53 < swiss> why
--- Day changed Fri Sep 07 2012
00:17 < alexjandro> WOOHOO I FINISHED
00:17 < swiss> fapping?
00:17 < alexjandro> vimtutor
00:17 < alexjandro> also, why can't I type
00:18 < swiss> vimtutor, fuckthis, it didn't use my vimrc
00:19 < alexjandro> nope
00:19 < swiss> fuckyou vimtutor
00:19 < swiss> :source ~/.vimrc
00:24 < swiss> huh, didn't realize 0 went to start of line
00:26 < alexjandro> haha
00:27 < swiss> i used ^
00:28 < swiss> i'm much more comfortable with using cw than ce
00:28 < swiss> is there a reason to use ce over cw?
00:30 < swiss> also, why do they use [number] G
00:30 < swiss> easier to do :number
00:34  * swiss has a few issues with it
00:49 < swiss> airen: fuck your penedactyl https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb
00:52 < alexjandro> Chrome Master Race
00:52 < swiss> alexjandro: install it
01:07 < zero-one> hotdogs: gradius: http://pastebin.com/gYh24bkb
01:09 < swiss> lol
01:10 < swiss> zero-one: I should get that 54-1-8 picture off my phone
01:10 < swiss> and you can link it everytime someone talks about a high score
01:10 < swiss> and say "this guy is shit, and look at what he got"
01:10 < alexjandro> swiss: i hate that extension
01:10 < swiss> alexjandro: why
01:11 < alexjandro> it gets stuck on a page, like gmail or something, then I can move away from it
01:11 < swiss> ?
01:11 < alexjandro> using J or K to move between tabs
01:12 < swiss> oh, i still use ctrl+tab to do that
01:12 < alexjandro> hmm seems like they were excluded in the Options
01:12 < swiss> but navigating within the page is nice
01:13 < alexjandro> also, I get to History or some other Chrome Tab, and now you're stuck again
01:13 < swiss> don't use J K for tab moving then
01:13 < swiss> but scrolling down with j and k is nice
01:13 < swiss> you've seen the arrow keys on my laptop, it's nearly impossible
01:14 < swiss> T looks like a cool command
01:15 < swiss> also, F
01:16 < alexjandro> FUCK
01:16 < alexjandro> I still can't switch between putty and chrome using ctrl + a , a
01:16 < alexjandro> haha
01:16 < swiss> xD
01:16 < swiss> fuck your putty
01:16 < swiss> and your nontiling window manager
01:17 < alexjandro> F is really cool
01:17 < alexjandro> except this
01:18 < alexjandro> nvm
01:18 < alexjandro> it doesn't see some things
01:18 < swiss> it should see all link
01:18 < swiss> links
01:18 < swiss> maybe not javascript buttons?
01:19 < alexjandro> how do I click on "1 new Tweet"?
01:19 < alexjandro> http://i.imgur.com/l1Mvc.png
01:20 < alexjandro> also, what if I don't want the links to open in a new tab
01:22 < swiss> don't hold shift then?
01:23 < alexjandro> im not
01:23 < swiss> err, other way around
01:23 < swiss> hold shift
01:23 < alexjandro> oh
01:23 < alexjandro> also, you get stuck on about:blank pages
01:23 < swiss> yeah
01:23 < swiss> i just ctrl+w those
01:23 < swiss> i learned to hit ? also
01:25 < alexjandro> wait so what do I do in insert mode?
01:25 < alexjandro> stupid question
01:26 < alexjandro> I have to tab to the text boxes
01:27 < swiss> or gi to go to next text box
01:27 < swiss> i don't understand why he lets you enter insert mode whenever though
01:28 < swiss> i wish it had a visual mode to copy text
01:28 < alexjandro> yea
01:28 < alexjandro> and try scrolling through gmail
01:28 < alexjandro> well, its more of a gmail issue than a extension issue
01:30 < alexjandro> THIS ISN'T 100% PERFECT FOR ME I DON'T LIKE IT
01:32 < zero-one> hotdogs: OH MAN. GUESS WHAT'S READY TO DOWNLOAD
01:33 < alexjandro> zero-one: WHAT IS IT
01:33 < hotdogs> my cock
01:33 < alexjandro> swiss: you should make a vim-syntax plugin for irssi
01:33 < swiss> alexjandro: i already have one
01:34 < swiss> i've been running it for around 48 hours now
01:34 < swiss> it's sometimes useful, but I turn it on and off
01:34 < swiss> and it steals controlC  so I can't greentext with it enabled
01:34 < swiss> alexjandro: you know you can make bash follow vim keybindings?
01:34 < swiss> set -o vi
01:35 < swiss> EVERYTHING IS BETTER WITH HJKL
01:36 < alexjandro> NOOO
01:36 < swiss> alexjandro: facebook is sucky with F
01:38 < swiss> well, some pages
01:41 < alexjandro> yes
01:43 < alexjandro> but it's nice for scrolling
01:44 < swiss> yeah
01:44 < swiss> alexjandro: we might just be able to save you.....
01:45 < alexjandro> nooo
01:45 < alexjandro> fuck I should go to bed
01:45 < alexjandro> but I don't want to
01:46 < swiss> i want to
01:46 < alexjandro> lets see how reddit works
01:47 < alexjandro> well fuck
01:47 < alexjandro> RES and this don't work
01:48 < alexjandro> nope
01:49 < swiss> RES doesn't work on my lappy anyways
01:49 < swiss> plus, RES has vim keybindings already
01:49 < alexjandro> yea, but I don't know them
01:49 < swiss> put http://*reddit.com/* in the ignored urls
01:49 < alexjandro> like h is to hide things
01:50 < swiss> the RES page sucks for me
01:51 < swiss> works fine on my desktop
01:51 < swiss> but RES on chrome on gentoo? apparently not
01:51 < swiss> i'mma try to sleep a bit I think
01:51 < swiss> &
01:51  * swiss &
01:52 < alexjandro> glhf
01:56 < alexjandro> swiss: haha yea you need to exclude reddit if you want to use RES
01:56 < zero-one> fucking fuck
01:56 < zero-one> they capped me at 1MB
01:57 < zero-one> this is gonna take all night and then some
01:57 < alexjandro> x in RES will expand the image/text but in the vimium x closes the tab
01:57 < alexjandro> and guess which one wins?
01:57 < alexjandro> zero-one: what are you downloading
01:59 < zero-one> http://i.imgur.com/S1s0W.jpg
02:00 < alexjandro> haha
02:00 < alexjandro> why 1MB
02:01 < zero-one> shitload of people trying to download from them at 30Mb/s
02:01 < zero-one> you do the math
02:01 < alexjandro> zero-one: just do a tracerotue and kick them off
02:02 < zero-one> oh yeah
02:02 < zero-one> why didn't i think of that before
02:02  * zero-one stabs himself with a spoon
02:04 < zero-one> holy shit, when did it become 2
02:04 < zero-one> i have to get up for work :(
02:05 < alexjandro> me too
09:32 < swiss> zero-one: wut
09:35 < alexjandro> swiss: did you sleep at all?
09:35 < swiss> alexjandro: yeah
09:35 < swiss> it was awesome
09:35 < swiss> got like 6 hours?
09:35 < swiss> my body feels so much better
09:39 < alexjandro> nice
09:44 < alexjandro> swiss: so I learned when doing an alignment that when I lowered my car, the geometry in the rear suspension changed to give me weird negative camber
09:45 < swiss> ll
09:45 < swiss> lol
09:45 < swiss> you didn't get it aligned imediately after lowering?
09:45 < swiss> i got lifetime alignment now, it's awesome
09:47 < alexjandro> how?
09:47 < alexjandro> and no, also, I can't change the back in the stock form
09:49 < swiss> you pay like $150 at firestone
09:49 < alexjandro> swiss: but the thing is now I have to take out my rear subframe again and weld in toe/camber kits
09:49 < swiss> lifetime alignment
09:49 < alexjandro> ricer statusx1000
09:49 < swiss> lolololol
09:50 < alexjandro> hmm thats not bad
09:50 < alexjandro> where do you usually buy tires
09:50 < alexjandro> when you replace them?
09:50 < swiss> TireRack.com :<
09:51 < swiss> my tires are really fucking expesive though
09:51 < alexjandro> why?
09:51 < swiss> which is why I have one wheel that I'm not using
09:51 < swiss> cause I have low rolling resistance tires
09:51 < swiss> Kumho Eco Wings
09:51 < swiss> and i think I'm paying like ~$75-100 per tire
09:53 < alexjandro> oh
09:53 < alexjandro> plus all the install and stuff
09:53 < alexjandro> I would say check out Discount Tire/Americas Tire
09:53 < alexjandro> they're awesome
10:03 < swiss> i'm talking 75-100 wihtout install :<
10:03 < alexjandro> i know
10:05 < alexjandro> I paid $65/tire for crappy Falkens
10:05 < timmah> swiss: sounds about right for Kumhos
10:06 < swiss> timmah: i am going with something fancier next
10:06 < swiss> cause my friend is hooking me up
10:06 < timmah> I think mine were the Kumhos Ecsta
10:06 < timmah> nice
10:06 < alexjandro> I want to find 15" version of the same wheels I have :/
10:07 < alexjandro> because 13" just looks too small
10:07 < swiss> trying to remember the name of them
10:07 < swiss> the really popular tire with ricers?
10:07 < alexjandro> timmah: how big are you wheels again?
10:07 < timmah> alexjandro: fucking toy-car sized
10:07 < alexjandro> haha
10:07 < alexjandro> swiss: they should name them StickyRice or something
10:07 < alexjandro> haha that would be a funny ricer tire
10:07 < timmah> 205/50?
10:07 < alexjandro> no, rim size
10:08 < timmah> width?
10:08 < timmah> I think 16
10:08 < alexjandro> 16" rims?
10:08 < swiss> I think I'm gonna get these rims next http://yourfairfieldcthome.com/modules/com_jcomments/rota-auto-x-1068.html
10:08 < timmah> ...
10:08 < timmah> fuck
10:08 < alexjandro> i find that hard to beleive
10:08 < timmah> hold on
10:08 < alexjandro> probably 13" like me
10:08 < swiss> timmah: i have 14" rims for comparison
10:09 < alexjandro> swiss: eww
10:09 < swiss> alexjandro: i like that style
10:09 < swiss> black with red lip
10:10 < swiss> and they'd cost maybe... $75 to 100 each for the rims
10:10 < timmah> alexjandro: 14"
10:10 < timmah> swiss: yeah, same size for us
10:10 < alexjandro> swiss: I want to find something like this but not black on black https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/558469_10150895468044027_1192728110_n.jpg
10:11 < timmah> swiss: Sorry mang, but I gotta agree with alexjandro. dem rims be ugly
10:11 < alexjandro> Also, I should email 23b in Fullerton about helping weld in my camber/toe plates
10:11 < alexjandro> because fuck paying a welding shop to do it
10:11 < timmah> it looks best on the black civic, but fuck the white cars. srsly
10:12 < swiss> well, i love the look of white w/ red but that never looks good on red cars
10:12 < alexjandro> yea, i think it fits the black civic best
10:12 < timmah> alexjandro: red miata looks good too
10:13 < swiss> alexjandro: lol, i barely looked through the pics x
10:13 < swiss> xD
10:13 < swiss> but i'e seen them on a red del sol before, and love them
10:13 < timmah> swiss: red car with the black/red hilights is good
10:13 < timmah> alexjandro: god I want my caterham :(
10:13 < alexjandro> swiss: want some bmw wheels? you're 4x100, right?
10:13 < alexjandro> timmah: are you saving?
10:14 < swiss> alexjandro: it's tempting to try it :P
10:14 < alexjandro> why not, what do you have to lose
10:14 < timmah> alexjandro: not yet :\
10:14 < alexjandro> you can't HAVE them, but just put them on and troll people
10:15 < timmah> there's one for sale for 31k, but I'd feel bad
10:15 < alexjandro> timmah: :( I made a spreadsheet to start pricing my engine rebuild and it's reaching 3k
10:15 < timmah> because they built it for racing and I'd be doing city driving
10:15 < alexjandro> and now 3k sounds like nothing compated to 31k
10:15 < timmah> lol
10:15 < timmah> well that's used
10:15 < timmah> new would be more like 42
10:15 < alexjandro> ouch

10:16 < swiss> alexjandro: that's what I was thinking
10:16 < timmah> alexjandro: I don't have anywhere to store it
10:16 < swiss> but the tire size might be bad
10:17 < swiss> lololol, i like that car timmah
10:17 < timmah> my dream is to buy this http://www.uscaterham.com/showroom/R400.html
10:17 < timmah> swiss: british know how to make good looking cars
10:17 < alexjandro> Wait, why would you buy a pre-built kit car
10:17 < timmah> but add ~10k for the engine, transmission
10:18 < timmah> alexjandro: that isn't prebuilt
10:18 < alexjandro> yea
10:18 < alexjandro> I want a fucking Morgan
10:18 < timmah> alexjandro: which one?
10:19 < timmah> the 3-wheeler? :P

10:24 < timmah> alright, fuck this dream-car circlejerk
10:25 < alexjandro> timmah: why would you ever get rid of that
10:25 < alexjandro> you should kill your parents
10:27 < timmah> alexjandro: the insurance costs for it were pretty high
10:28 < timmah> it was also not running, and I hadn't worked on it in a while
10:28 < timmah> and was off at college
10:32 < alexjandro> Should have registered it non-op and just canceled the insurance
10:32 < alexjandro> You don't need insurance if you're not driving it
10:33 < timmah> shoulda, woulda, coulda
10:33 < timmah> It was also getting damn expensive to fix since the parts are getting rare
10:33 < timmah> if I could have, I would have replaced the engine with a toyota v6 and transmission
10:33 < timmah> more power, better parts
10:33 < timmah> but no carb
10:33 < timmah> oh well
10:34 < hotdogs> AND NOW YOU NEVER WILL
10:35 < alexjandro> timmah: yea, oh well, sucks

10:44 < timmah> project car!
10:44 < swiss> timmah: i can't buy one as my second car though
10:44 < swiss> QQ
10:44 < swiss> I made myself promise my second car would have 5 seats
10:44 < airen> gradius: http://www.speedtest.net/result/2165702680.png (working from LA today)
10:45 < timmah> swiss: So I'm okay because my first car seats 5?
10:45 < timmah> hooray!
10:45 < timmah> airen: nice
10:45 < timmah> you got gigabit to your machine?
10:45 < swiss> airen: i jizzed a bit seeing that
10:45 < swiss> timmah: yeah, you're safe
10:46 < swiss> lucky you QQ
10:46 < airen> timmah: Yeah, my lappy has gigglebit.
10:46 < swiss> I'll never sell the sol (at least, i don't plan to) as I'd never get back anywhere near the money I put in
10:46 < hotdogs> timmah: more like seats 3
10:47 < alexjandro> timmah: DO IT
10:47 < timmah> hotdogs: modular?
10:47 < alexjandro> DO IT FAGGOT
10:47 < timmah> alexjandro: I don't have anywhere to store it
10:47 < timmah> or a way to transport it
10:47 < hotdogs> swiss: pretty sure there's a logical fallacy in there somewhere
10:48 < alexjandro> hotdogs: explain
10:49 < swiss> hotdogs: I told myself I wouldn't buy a second car that was also a 2 seater
10:49 < swiss> cause otherwise I'd have two cars that had no difference in purpose
10:49 < hotdogs> sunk cost dilemma?
10:49 < timmah> hotdogs: sounds like it
10:50 < swiss> oh, in my sol?
10:50 < swiss> i thought you meant in the "second car 5 seats" thing
10:50 < hotdogs> no, in your "I'll never sell it because I won't get what I paid for it"
10:50 < swiss> oh, yeah...
10:50 < swiss> well, i won't be able to sell it for over 4 grand really
10:51 < swiss> except when the guy offered me 8.... i should have taken that
10:51 < swiss> stupid attatchment feelins
10:51 < alexjandro> stupid feels
10:51 < swiss> QQ
10:51 < swiss> it was when i took it in to get detailed
10:52 < swiss> the shop owner of the car shop next to the detailer
10:52 < timmah> swiss: see if he's still up for it
10:52 < timmah> first get your eye on a new ride though
10:53 < swiss> "Is that a del sol!?!?!? Yours looks really nice, how many miles?" "180k miles" "And it's running strong?" "Yeah" "How much do you want for it? Would you take 8 grand?" "Err.... sorry. I should, i'm crazy to say no, but I'm too attatched"
10:53 < swiss> timmah: this was a year ago
10:53 < swiss> and i do love my sol still
10:53 < swiss> and around 8 grand has gone into it now
10:53 < swiss> it was only 5 grand when he offered
11:24 < DrItanium> BANJAX
13:34 < alexjandro> oh god
13:35 < hotdogs> YES?
13:35 < alexjandro> i read this as "exam" at first: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zhwn4/to_the_dudes_who_have_experienced_such_a_thing/

23:11 < drboots> Yet another Saturday night spent in front of my laptop
23:16 < swiss> wooooo I got all my ssl shit working
23:16 < swiss> and different certificates/keys for different levels of security
23:43 < alexjandro> swiss: sooo I may be going carb'd when I do my rebuild. I was hanging out with some other BMW guys today and they were preaching on how much simpler and easier to tune it is compared to the stock mechanical fuel injection system and even a greater gain in hp/torque.
23:43 < alexjandro> But then I would lose a lot of mpg. :(
23:44 < swiss> Berzerker: hahha
23:44 < swiss> err
23:44 < swiss> alexjandro:
23:44 < swiss> diff hcannel
23:46 < alexjandro> also it sounds nice
23:46 < alexjandro> as in the carbs make noise and they sound nice
23:53 < alexjandro> gahhh i don't know what to do
23:53 < alexjandro> I guess I should worry about the intake later and focus on the block/head now
23:55 < swiss> yeah
23:55 < swiss> does it matter when you're working on the block/head what sort of injection you're using?
--- Day changed Sun Sep 09 2012
00:03 < alexjandro> nope,
00:04 < alexjandro> well, kinda, but not really. The block is all the same for like 30 years worth of cars
00:04 < alexjandro> and the only thing I would have to do on the head is plug the holes for the injectors, which is easy
00:04 < swiss> then run it with injection at first (since you already have the parts)
00:04 < swiss> and when you get rich switch it over
00:05 < alexjandro> but when I get rich I want to do Megasquirt
00:06 < alexjandro> swiss: have you heard of Megasquirt before? It's awesome
00:06 < swiss> nope
00:06 < alexjandro> its an EE's wet dream for EFI
00:07 < swiss> haha
00:07 < alexjandro> you pretty much build the system using their controller board, and you can tune and log all sorts of data
00:07 < alexjandro> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaSquirt
00:09 < alexjandro> you build and tune it yourself, and its all open hardware
00:10 < swiss> how much does it cost?
00:16 < alexjandro> from $200 to $600 just for the ECU depending if you buy a kit or build it yourself. then you need to fit it all to your car
00:20 < swiss> conisdering the fact the ECU would cost me $150-200 anyway when I swap engines......
00:20 < swiss> i might do this in a year or so
00:25 < swiss> http://www.diyautotune.com/diypnp/apps/n76/usdm-honda-civic-9295-d16z6-mt.html exactly for the engine I'd be getting too
00:25 < swiss> would cost ~$430
00:31 < alexjandro> haha yea, it'd be easier for you since you already have EFI
00:31 < alexjandro> i would need to get an intake off a newer bmw that has electronic injectors
00:31 < alexjandro> but it can and has been done
00:31 < alexjandro> also, you'd have fun being a EE major
00:32 < alexjandro> DO IT
00:37 < swiss> hahah
00:37 < swiss> i am still planning on writing/creating my own efi ICE software as my senior project
00:40 < alexjandro> ICE?
00:44 < swiss> Integrated Car Environment
00:47 < alexjandro> so something to control the engine, lights, and media(radio/gps)?
00:53 < swiss> buy this for me http://www.hondata.com/s300.html
00:53 < swiss> well, it could do all those things
00:54 < swiss> but the ICE I want to make would replace the current gauge cluster with a digital view, displaying many other car stats it doesn't usually
00:56 < alexjandro> oh i see, thats cool too
00:56 < alexjandro> and ill buy you that if you buy me cast pistons
00:57 < airen> timmah: http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3qtz3y/
00:58 < swiss> alexjandro: lol
01:00 < alexjandro> they're cheaper than the most expensive module you linked
01:07 < swiss> 2http://wikitest.pgmfi.org/twiki/bin/view.pl/Home/PGMFIsHistory
01:07 < swiss> err
01:07 < swiss> http://wikitest.pgmfi.org/twiki/bin/view.pl/Home/PGMFIsHistory
01:07 < swiss> we should do that
01:07 < swiss> "It was started because Dave needed something to do. Having lots of free time on his hands and needing a distraction after a painful breakup, Dave wanted a turbo CRX.... Only Dave couldn't afford a Zdyne or Hondata, "
01:10 < alexjandro> Hack your ECU or help him?
01:11 < swiss> hack my ecu
01:11 < swiss> obviously
01:11 < swiss> fuckk helping others :P
01:19 < alexjandro> Yea, cause starting from scratch is much better than taking what someone else has done and making it better
01:21 < swiss> no, we should do what he did
01:21 < swiss> it's all on that page
01:21 < swiss> how to mod my ecu on the cheap
01:22 < swiss> http://wikitest.pgmfi.org/twiki/bin/view.pl/Library/PartsForECUs
01:24 < alexjandro> what do I have to do
01:24 < swiss> ermmmm
01:25 < swiss> you can pay for it P
01:25 < swiss> :P
01:25 < swiss> do you even have an ECU in your car?
01:29 < alexjandro> yea, kinda, idk what it does though
01:30 < alexjandro> i think its for emissions though
01:34 < alexjandro> okay so it seems like a takes a reading from the oxygen sensor and uses that you adjust the A/F mixture
01:34 < swiss> ll
01:35 < alexjandro> but it doesn't directly control spark or the injectors
01:35 < swiss> how does it adjust the AF then?
01:35 < swiss> limit the intake?
01:40 < swiss> holy shit this stuff is well documented
01:44 < alexjandro> hmm so it seems like it adjust the fuel by using a "frequency control valve", and thats how it adjust the mixture
01:44 < alexjandro> i think
01:44 < alexjandro> i don't know what this "frequency control valve" is though
01:45 < alexjandro> but you can unplug the computer and the car will run just fine, and sometime better, without it
01:49 < swiss> why don't you?
01:53 < alexjandro> it works better unplugged when your O2 sensor in wonkey or something else. Otherwiese it doesn't matter if you have it in or nor
01:53 < alexjandro> not*
02:11 < swiss> ah
02:11 < swiss> so it'd cost me $15 for the stuff to chip my ecu
02:11 < swiss> except the EEPROM writer
02:11 < swiss> i should ask my dad if he has one... i will tomorrow
02:11 < swiss> i bet he does
02:11 < alexjandro> nice
02:30 < swiss> or nsl would have them

22:14 < alexjandro> yes
22:14 < airen> What's the problem?
22:15 < alexjandro> Not saving the psk, I think it has something to do with dbus or something
22:15 < swiss> alexjandro: wicd-curses
22:15 < alexjandro> what
22:15 < swiss> doit
22:15 < alexjandro> what is that
22:15 < swiss> type wicd-curses
22:16 < swiss> ncurses interface to wicd
22:16 < prometheusx> it's a gui
22:16 < swiss> prometheusx: kinda, in the same way irssi is a gui I guess
22:16 < swiss> and if dbus isn't started wicd-curses will give you that error
22:17 < swiss> but you're supposed to start wicd then connect to it with wicd-curses, wicd-gtk, etc
22:17 < alexjandro> nope no errors
22:18 < swiss> and you can connect?
22:18 < alexjandro> no

22:21 < airen> Also, can you connect sans wicd?

22:25 < airen> alexjandro: wpa_passphrase ssid passphrase >> /etc/wpasupplicant.conf
22:28 < swiss> i like wicd
22:28 < swiss> alexjandro: what are your use opts on wicd?
22:29 < airen> swiss: wicd is okay
22:29 < airen> But I want to isolate the problem.
22:29 < alexjandro> airen: yes works just fine with wpa_sup
22:30 < airen> alexjandro: Well, now we know it isn't your drivers or your hardware.
22:30 < airen> alexjandro: This is on Gentoo?
22:30 < airen> I'm wondering if it's a python problem.
22:30 < swiss> alexjandro: equery u wicd
22:30 < airen> Since iirc Gentoo moved to python3 by default a little while ago.
22:31 < alexjandro> airen: yes gentoo, and yea, I did have to change it using select for something else
22:31 < swiss> alexjandro: alright, su, then wicd -f
22:31 < swiss> then in another terminal window wicd-curses and try to conncet
22:32 < alexjandro> hahaha so I connected using wpa_sup, and now wicd shows as being connected
22:33 < alexjandro> swiss: Failed to connect to wpa_supplicant - wpa_ctrl_open: No such file or directory
22:34 < swiss> i'm copypasting that into google
22:34 < alexjandro> so am i
22:54 < alexjandro> it doesn't like using python 3 either
22:55 < airen> alexjandro: iirc wicd is python 2.x
22:56 < swiss> alexjandro: set it to 2.7
22:57 < swiss> eselect python list
22:57 < swiss> eselect python set (whatever number 2.7 was)
23:00 < alexjandro> yea, it was on that before, but i tried 3 just to see what would happen
23:03 < swiss> is root on 2.7?
23:05 < alexjandro> yes
23:05 < alexjandro> would my user need to be on 2.7 as well?
23:05 < airen> No.
23:05 < alexjandro> well, he is
23:06 < swiss> alexjandro: emerge wicd

23:41 < swiss> gl;hf
23:41 < zero-one> i've done apps like that before
23:42 < zero-one> hopefully it all works out the same
23:42 < swiss> well, you can't do mouse clicks
23:42 < swiss> not eaisily, cause the time changes as load changes
23:46 < zero-one> i'll find out
23:55 < alexjandro> noo bad zero-one, hacking is bad
--- Day changed Mon Sep 10 2012
00:01 < swiss> zero-one: got MAT214, but couldn't switch my physics lab to wednesday
00:01 < swiss> QQ
00:03 < zero-one> alexjandro: not if it gets you your classes before everyone else
00:04 < zero-one> COMPUTER PROGRAMMER MASTER RACE
00:05 < swiss> zero-one: make a proxy, statch hte traffic
00:06 < zero-one> wat
00:07 < zero-one> spell that right, maybe it'll make more sense
00:07 < zero-one> i have a feeling it won't anyway
00:07 < alexjandro> snatch the traffic
00:07 < alexjandro> those are hacker terms
00:07 < swiss> zero-one: http://i.imgur.com/qvwJz.png
10:03 < gradius> HACKING IS BEST
10:03 < gradius> Hi.
10:03 < gradius> <3
10:04 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: The overlords would like to remind you that a proper diet is key to success.
10:06 < swiss> s/a// s/diet/diet and exercise/
10:06 < swiss> FTFY
10:06 < airen> alexjandro: Huh, interesting.
10:07 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: The overlords would like to remind you that swiss is fat.
10:08 -!- ChanServ changed the topic of #testgradius to: The overlords would like to remind you that namecalling is mean, and is encouraged.
10:13  * DrItanium puches ChanServ
10:13  * DrItanium corrects his spelling
10:13  * DrItanium punches ChanServ
10:14 < gradius> haha.
10:14  * gradius hugs DrItanium 
10:14 < alexjandro> airen: what? the wicd thing?
10:16 < airen> alexjandro: yeah.
10:18 < alexjandro> yeah, I posted in #wicd, so I'll let you know when I figure it out
10:20 < airen> Cool.
10:20 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Why wicd and not just start wpa_supplicant with the computer?
10:21 < alexjandro> Because I'm a noob and want to use the gui tool
10:21 < DrItanium> Ah
10:22 < DrItanium> I had the impression you were using it at the command line or something
10:23 < DrItanium> But that's probably pretty smart as /etc/init.d/dhcpcd will fail for me right now because eth0 and eth1 are not connected but I want wlan0
10:23 < DrItanium> I have to do it manually
10:24 < DrItanium> So any tool to make that a less of an annoyance would be welcome
11:35 < swiss> so chunkhost is offering a free for life VPS
11:36 < swiss> has to be linked w/ your facebook account though
11:36 < swiss> so create a fake facebook
11:36 < swiss> http://chunkhost.com/r/Christopher-Schafer
11:38 < airen> wut
11:46 < hotdogs> up to 2gb of what
11:47 < airen> dunnah
11:48 < swiss> RAM
11:48 < swiss> and it has to do with # of referrals (hence my posting of my referral link)
11:48 < swiss> but 128 free
11:48 < swiss> for life
11:49 < hotdogs> well now I'm definitely not doing it
11:49 < swiss> and you can increase that 128 you get free for life by 64 MB for each refferal you get, where they actually upgrade it when you hit each number they'd upgrade to.
11:49 < gradius> hotdogs: can I make an account and have you use mine?
11:49 < swiss> hotdogs: you don't have to. nor do you have to use my referral
11:49 < hotdogs> gradius: Yes
11:49 < swiss> idrc if I ahve more than 128, but if it gets up to a lot through people using my referral, I wouldn't mind :P
11:49 < gradius> swiss: actual question
11:49 < DrItanium> pyramid scheme
11:50 < swiss> gradius: yes?
11:50 < gradius> do they have to be paying members to get that 64MB?
11:50 < gradius> or can they also use free tier
11:50 < gradius> b/c if so
11:50 < gradius> REFERAL FARMING
11:50 < swiss> free tier I believe
11:50 < gradius> nice.
11:50 < swiss> and I'm seroiusly considering it
11:50 < swiss> Oh, and you dont put in credit card info... at all
11:50 < gradius> yeah
11:50 < gradius> I wanna try a 128 and see their preformance.
11:51 < gradius> performance.
11:51 < gradius> how do you spell that damn work
11:51 < gradius> word*
11:51 < swiss> oh, it's good
11:51 < gradius> not bad.
11:51 < swiss> i've had a chunkhost before
11:51 < gradius> ah
11:51 < hotdogs> you should test both preformance and performance
11:51 < hotdogs> and postformance
11:51 < swiss> and their uptime was amazing
11:51 < gradius> what about uptime/tickets
11:51 < gradius> hotdogs: <3
11:51 < swiss> i didn't submit any tickets
11:51 < swiss> for the paying customers, if it goes down they give *all* the money back
11:52 < swiss> that they paid for that month
11:52 < gradius> wow.
11:52 < gradius> I'll take a look at that then
11:53 < hotdogs> zero-one: hey bro you misspelled your password or something
11:53 < hotdogs> for wireless
11:53 < airen> Sounds like a botnet
11:53 < gradius> lol hotdogs
11:54 < gradius> you creepin the logs?
11:54 < hotdogs> yeah
11:54 < gradius> airen: that's what I was thinking about
11:54 < hotdogs> he's failing over and over
11:55 < gradius> I just wanna run my own cloud!
11:55 < gradius> hotdogs: lol did it catch your eye or did you have to search for him?
11:55 < gradius> because if so I want to spam auth fails to say hi to you
11:56 < hotdogs> too bad you're on the other side of the world now
11:58 < swiss> gradius: https://chunkhost.com/faq SLA
11:59 < swiss> gradius: only 3 GB of space on the free VPS I think as well
11:59 < zero-one> hotdogs: yeah, i did
11:59 < zero-one> lol
11:59 < zero-one> that's fucking creepy
11:59 < alexjandro> hotdogs: find my logs, there is bound to be a ton
12:00 < hotdogs> I don't have logs from before last thursday.
12:00 < swiss> gradius: errr, i read wrong the first time. "Prorated refund for the time it was down"
12:00 < swiss> i mean, it's better than buyvm
12:00 < swiss> but it's not that good
12:00 < alexjandro> gradius: WOOHOO ON THE JOB
12:01 < gradius> alexjandro: thanks mang :)
12:02 < alexjandro> So when is the housewarming party?
12:02 < gradius> It's nice to know that I'm here for sure and not just a "yeah you're likely goign to get hired"
12:02 < gradius> haha
12:02 < gradius> alexjandro: we're talking about doing one soon
12:02 < alexjandro> Yes
12:02 -!- dande1ion [~someone@fluffy.unx.csupomona.edu] has joined #testgradius
12:02 < gradius> Just we've had previous plans set up for last weekend + this weekend
12:02 < gradius> but most likely a party after that :)
12:02 < alexjandro> :D
12:03 < hotdogs> gradius: so can you start banning people now
12:03 < gradius> suuuuure :P
12:03 < gradius> (more like I can forward requests to player support)
12:03 < zero-one> gradius: the police just called the credit union
12:03 < hotdogs> with a note saying "ban immediately"
12:03 < gradius> after that slipup with someone banning a player while on a livestream
12:03 < zero-one> i accidentaly tripped the alarm under the desk with my knee
12:04 < alexjandro> HAHAHAHHAHAHA
12:04 < gradius> they removed player support tool as an all access tool
12:04 < gradius> also zero-one
12:04 < gradius> that was a fear of mine since day one
12:04 < gradius> I'm shocked I never triggered it.
12:04 < gradius> grats.
12:04 < gradius> :P
12:04 < zero-one> hahaha
12:04 < alexjandro> zero-one: you didn't hear the alarm go off or anything?
12:04 < gradius> like my first week, I was afraid to sit under the desk
12:04 < gradius> alexjandro: silent alarm
12:04 < alexjandro> gradius: THATS THE JOKE
12:05 < gradius> :|
12:05 -!- dande1ion is now known as sunrisewolf
12:05 < gradius> alexjandro:  I didn't know you knew it was sieltn
12:05 -!- sunrisewolf [~someone@fluffy.unx.csupomona.edu] has quit [Changing host]
12:05 -!- sunrisewolf [~someone@unaffiliated/sunrisewolf] has joined #testgradius
12:05 < gradius> silent
12:05 -!- sunrisewolf is now known as dande1ion
12:05 < gradius> HI dande1ion !
12:05 < alexjandro> gradius: what bank would't have a silent alarm
12:05 < gradius> alexjandro: AN AWESOME ROCK BANK
12:05 < gradius> idk
12:05 < gradius> Memory banks?
12:05 < gradius> idk
12:06 < gradius> river bank
12:06 < alexjandro> fuck you
12:06 < gradius> alexjandro: promise?
12:06 < alexjandro> gradius: financial institution*
12:06 < alexjandro> and yes, i promise
12:10 < zero-one> gradius: joy moved the desk so that it faces the same wall that the tellers face
12:10 < zero-one> this is balls
12:10 < zero-one> now everyone can see what i'm doing all the time
12:10 < zero-one> and customers always try to sit here
12:10 < gradius> lol im sorry :(
12:11 < gradius> Why'd that happen? :|
12:11 < zero-one> i was complaining about space
12:11 < zero-one> and she gave me space
12:11 < zero-one> :(
12:11 < zero-one> actually, now that i think of it
12:12 < zero-one> i don't think that's why she moved it
12:12 < zero-one> she moved it because there's a lot more space here now
12:12 < zero-one> not because I needed space
12:12 < zero-one> EITHER WAY THIS IS BALLS
12:13 < hotdogs> brb opening account info in front of other customers
12:14 < zero-one> I KNOW
12:14 < zero-one> i'm sorting through statements from 2011, and people can see
12:14 < zero-one> not my problem i guess
12:15 < hotdogs> DIWCU
12:15 < hotdogs> doin it wrong credit union
12:16 < hotdogs> gradius: oh, it's good that that incident actually caused an internal change
12:16 < hotdogs> I think I remember reading the uproar about it, seemed fucked up
12:17 < zero-one> what incident?
12:18 < gradius> zero-one: you might actually want to mention that to joy
12:18 < gradius> it's a valid concern
12:18 < gradius> all other motives aside
12:19 < zero-one> gradius: i've tried before, and i don't think bringing that up will change her mind
12:19 < hotdogs> zero-one: you should mention it so it's her fault when it's a problem
12:19 < hotdogs> also, written evidence
12:21 < gradius> CYA is a good thing
12:21 < zero-one> CYA LATER
12:22 < gradius> har har
12:30 < hotdogs> I get it
12:30 < hotdogs> zero-one: GETTIN HUNGRY?
12:30 < hotdogs> oh right you're poor
12:50 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm poor until financial aid comes out again
12:57 < hotdogs> oh boy
13:24 < prometheusx> hotdogs: im hungry
13:25 < hotdogs> where you wanna go, champ
13:25 < hotdogs> chipotle?
13:25 < prometheusx> im in la :P
13:25 < hotdogs> chipotle?
13:25 < zero-one> hotdogs: we should eat lunch on campus!
13:25 < prometheusx> qdabo
13:25 < hotdogs> NEVER
13:25 < hotdogs> zero-one: what's open
13:26 < prometheusx> not a damn thing!
13:26 < zero-one> hotdogs: subway, denny's, Kika
13:28 < hotdogs> nope
13:29 < prometheusx> i want to go back to yosemite, it's too hot here
13:32 < hotdogs> zero-one: why would you want to eat on campus
13:33 < zero-one> hotdogs: because i have a million broncobucks
13:33 < zero-one> which i can use instead of cash
13:34 < DrItanium> ahh the good olde CPP monopoly money
13:34 < hotdogs> how'd you get broncobucks
13:34 < zero-one> hotdogs: family keeps sending them to me
13:34 < hotdogs> that's a good plan, actually
13:34 < hotdogs> since there isn't a gun store on campus
13:34 < zero-one> hotdogs: lolol
13:35 < zero-one> i should feel bad
13:35 < zero-one> i've spent $1000 of money they sent me to buy guns :(
13:36 < hotdogs> when you were supposed to use it on video games
13:36 < alexjandro> zero-one: NO GIVE IT TO ME
13:36 < alexjandro> I wish they would have given me more subsidized loans so I could have spent it on my engine
13:40 < DrItanium> Well there is a way to convert bronco bucks to real money :D
13:42 < airen> zero-one: Not the smartest financial decision ever.
13:44 < zero-one> DrItanium: SHARE
13:44 < zero-one> SHARE SO I CAN FINALLY PAY RENT
13:45 < prometheusx> timmah: !
13:45 < DrItanium> It's not that kind of instant payout
13:46 < zero-one> DrItanium: er... then what are we talking about here
13:46 < DrItanium> Getting reimbursed for CSS events if you pay for them with bronco bucks
13:46 < zero-one> 0_0
13:46 < DrItanium> I don't know if they still allow it
13:46 < zero-one> dat loophole
13:47 < DrItanium> As I said it's not an instant conversion
13:47 < DrItanium> Plus I believe that your parents probably made them into broncobucks to prevent exactly what you've already done
14:05 < zero-one> lolol
14:05 < alexjandro> The bookstore should sell guns then
14:05 < airen> alexjandro: They tried that in Colorado.
14:05 < airen> Didn't work so well.
14:06 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Right...that's a really bad idea....even worse than my idea of a knife shop on campus
14:06 < zero-one> DrItanium: we should have a knife shop on campus
14:06 < zero-one> excellent idea
14:07 < DrItanium> Well my reasoning was pretty stupid actually. It was so that I could heckle the owner with puns every single day
14:07 < hotdogs> just sell things from the knife rack on your bike
14:08 < hotdogs> knives and shopkeeps reminds me of http://wiki.lspace.org/wiki/Cut-Me-Own-Throat_Dibbler
14:08 < DrItanium> hotdogs: yes it does...I love discworld..too bad pratchett is becoming demented :(
14:09 < hotdogs> I think he's blind already
14:09 < DrItanium> :(
14:09 < hotdogs> I thought I read something about how he was still writing
14:10 < DrItanium> I know he had to use audio transcription software to write his books since he can't type anymore
14:10 < hotdogs> oh maybe that was it
14:10 < DrItanium> Ah, he has alzheimer's :(
14:25 < swiss> gonna try out luakit as a browser
14:26 < hotdogs> oh god, he lost his touch typing ability
14:27 < hotdogs> I think I would kill myself at that point
14:27 < DrItanium> swiss: so it's surf with a different keyboard layout
14:27 < swiss> DrItanium: surf was made more for those who are comfortable with dwm, luakit seems more awesome oriented
14:28 < DrItanium> too bad webkit fails horribly on ia64 as I'm interested :(
14:28 < swiss> DrItanium: i have 1GB of memory on this laptop, gecko is too heavy :/
14:29 < swiss> at least, that's what google has led me to believe
14:29 < airen> swiss: dillo
14:29 < airen> swiss: midori
14:29 < airen> swiss: netsurf
14:29 < DrItanium> airen: dillo doesn't have javascript support
14:29 < airen> swiss: surf
14:29 < airen> swiss: uzbl
14:29 < DrItanium> netsurf doesn't have javascript support
14:29 < airen> DrItanium: An even better reason to use it.
14:29 < airen> swiss: seamonkey
14:29 < DrItanium> airen: You say that looking out
14:29 < DrItanium> but on the other side :(
14:29 < airen> lol
14:29 < DrItanium> I just use firefox with no script
14:30 < swiss> airen: gecko
14:30 < swiss> i beliee
14:30 < swiss> I was gonna try midori as well
14:30 < swiss> gecko w/ seamonkey that is
14:31 < airen> swiss: jah jah
14:31 < airen> swiss: midori is pretty light, I've used it before.
14:31 < DrItanium> links
14:31 < DrItanium> lynx
14:32 < swiss> but http://www.linuxized.com/2010/08/luakit-fast-small-webkit-based-micro-browser-extensible-by-lua/ is why I'm gonna try luakit
14:32 < swiss> DrItanium: i want full browser functionality as far as webpages go
14:32 < DrItanium> I understand that
14:32 < swiss> links/lynx I'd have issues w/ image heavy webpages
14:32 < DrItanium> I'm just naming off alternative browers
14:32 < DrItanium> links -g
14:35 < airen> elinks > links > lynx
14:36 < DrItanium> swiss: Internet Explorer in VMWare
14:36 < DrItanium> IE6
14:38 < swiss> lol
14:47 < prometheusx> DrItanium: your suggestion is bad and you should feel bad
14:47 < DrItanium> Nope
14:52 < alexjandro> DrItanium: It's great
14:52 < DrItanium> alexjandro: Thank you :D
15:00 < swiss> DrItanium: quick question: is there any real reason to restrict my linguas?
15:00 < DrItanium> I have no clue
15:01 < DrItanium> Oh, yes there is
15:01 < DrItanium> some packages will install all of them if you don't provide one
15:01 < DrItanium> plus it can cut down on space consumption too
15:01 < swiss> yeah, but does that increase the package's memory usage?
15:01 < swiss> or is it just disk space
15:01 < DrItanium> REducing the number of linguas?
15:02 < DrItanium> How would that increase memory usage?
15:04 < swiss> 15:01:19 < DrItanium> some packages will install all of them if you don't provide one
15:04 < swiss> would that increase the packages memory usage is what I was asking
15:05 < swiss> (RAM, not disk space)
15:05 < airen> swiss: Depends on how they load them.
15:06 < DrItanium> yes that can increase memory consumption
15:06 < DrItanium> but emphasis on can
15:06 < swiss> well, chrome compiled with all of them
15:06 < DrItanium> linguas is not the same as supported fonts for different languages
15:06 < swiss> and I wonder if that has the same effect
15:07 < swiss> DrItanium: I'm trying to find good documentation on exactly what it effects, but I can't quite understand it
15:23 < zero-one> hotdogs: oh yeah, forgot about that rack. it's to the left of the shotgun rack, and in front of the pizza rack
15:34 < timmah> prometheusx: ?
15:36 < prometheusx> timmah: bowrang?
15:36 < timmah> dono
15:39 < prometheusx> ok, let me know, i'll be here boiling at work
15:47 < swiss> linguas apparently tells packages whether to install the MO files for language....
15:47 < swiss> time to learn what MO files are!
15:49 < hotdogs> Missouri files
15:55 < timmah> prometheusx: rgr
15:56 < swiss> Ok, now i understand kind of what they are, but I'm stuck. I know it's creating the bitcode style files for the program to read... now I don't know if it matters :/
16:14 < swiss> but it seems like linguas might have to do with documentation moreso?
16:14 < swiss> I'll ask in #swift
19:59 < swiss> so luakit seems like penadactyl, but better :P
20:12 < hotdogs> stop saying bitcode
20:13 < hotdogs> woops, forgot this channel has been so slow
20:28 < airen> nibblecode
22:01 < zero-one> hotdogs: you're slow
22:03 < hotdogs> huh?
22:04 < zero-one> you called this channel slow
22:04 < zero-one> SO I'M STICKING UP FOR IT
22:04  * zero-one pats the channel on the back
22:07 < hotdogs> okay white knight
--- Day changed Tue Sep 11 2012
09:08 < timmah> zero-one: I'm pretty sure you'll hit 80 before I do
09:57 < hotdogs> because he has no self-control?
10:04 < timmah> because he has more will to grind it out than I do
10:05 < timmah> although I got almost 2 levels from crafting last night
10:08 < alexjandro> hotdogs: self control isn't needed
10:16 < timmah> I made firefox cry :(
10:23 < alexjandro> Explain
10:26 < timmah> opening 119 tabs at once
10:28 < alexjandro> Well, there's you're problem
10:29 < timmah> yep
10:35 < timmah> but that's what happens when microsoft doesn't have a good hierarchy scheme
10:42 < DrItanium> timmah: Tab groups are your friend in that case
10:43 < DrItanium> but that doesn't help in your case....
10:43 < timmah> yeah
10:43 < timmah> also google thought I was a bot :|
10:45 < DrItanium> From your spamming?
10:45 < timmah> for opening google.com/#q=[my queries]
10:45 < timmah> 119 times
10:46 < airen> looool
10:47 < timmah> now I have to go download all the pages!
10:47 < timmah> windows ~.~
10:50 < timmah> I might have been able to script this better with curl
10:51 < prometheusx> timmah: so much porn
10:58 < timmah> so much kb*
11:57 -!- Netsplit *.net <-> *.split quits: zero-one, drboots
11:58 < timmah> crap, I missed one.
11:58 < timmah> I don't know which one
11:58 -!- Netsplit over, joins: zero-one, drboots
12:00 -!- drboots [drboots@calpolyswift.org] has quit [Remote host closed the connection]
12:00 -!- drboots [drboots@calpolyswift.org] has joined #testgradius
12:40 < zero-one> hotdogs: it's true, i have no self-control
12:40 < zero-one> BUT AT LEAST I'LL BE LEVEL 80
12:41 < hotdogs> and then you can quit the game
12:44 < prometheusx> ha ha, no end game
12:46 < hotdogs> make another character, then
12:48 < timmah> prometheusx: everything is an end game
12:49 < timmah> especially with the level normalization
13:00 < hotdogs> that too
14:53 < swiss> so now zero-one has met swissdad
14:54 < swiss> how exciting for him :P
14:54 < timmah> let's hope they don't breed
14:54 < timmah> oh wait too late
14:57 < timmah> That was funnier in my head.
15:58 < drboots> timmah: Still fairly funny
16:11 < zero-one> swiss: oh yeah, that was exciting
16:13 < swiss> hahaha
16:14 < swiss> he behaved himself today too :P
17:31 < alexjandro> eww i smell like upsexy

10:45 < swiss> alexjandro: do you have work tomorrow?
12:32 < mendez> gradius: writing a fuzzer that has a try-catch block that nests 5 deep
12:32 < mendez> gradius: am i winning yet?
12:51 < DrItanium> mendez: try/catch? 5 deep ? you're probably doing something wrong
12:52 < DrItanium> but why so deep?
12:52 < prometheusx> he's trying to go balls deep
12:52 < DrItanium> Are there different aspects of the code that you need to catch?
12:52 < DrItanium> differently?
12:53 < DrItanium> If so you can attach mutiple catch clauses to a single try statement
12:53 < DrItanium> However, I think the deepest I've ever gone is three deep
13:00 < mendez> DrItanium: trying a bunch of different techniques to fuck with the return address in memory, when they fail they all throw an exception and i have to launch em in a certian order :P
13:01 < DrItanium> Are they the same type of exception?
13:01 < airen> DrItanium: I've gone way deeper than three.
13:03 < DrItanium> Let me pull up my LR1 parser
13:03 < DrItanium> Well...technically if we want to include implied try catch then mine would be infinitely deep
13:03 < DrItanium> dat yield statement
13:06 < DrItanium> huh...it looks like I took out the try/caches
13:06 < DrItanium> *catches
13:07 < DrItanium> Let me see about the lexical analyzer
13:07 < airen> Mine was a sex joke.
13:08 < DrItanium> ah
13:08 < DrItanium> sorry mine were implied try/finally blocks
13:08 < DrItanium> wait wait...nested try
13:09 < DrItanium> nuts only two deep recursive try/finally
13:11 < DrItanium> god generics get nasty when they're two deep
13:11 < DrItanium> Tuple<Token<T>, Token<T>>
13:14 < DrItanium> HAHAHA, I forgot about my interface that is write only
13:28 < hotdogs> balls deep in generics

13:05 < swiss> but i guess on the front I also have the toe arm
13:05 < alexjandro> swiss: Yea, i know, mine sucks
13:06 < swiss> alexjandro: funny thing is, double wishbone came first

13:03 < zero-one> timmah: GO
13:06 < alexjandro> 90% yes
13:13 < jtbot_> timmah: GO
13:13 < alexjandro> oh now
13:13 < alexjandro> no
13:14 < alexjandro> not jtbot_ will see all the work i don't dp
13:14 < alexjandro> do*
13:16 -!- jtbot_ is now known as jtbot
13:16 < alexjandro> zero-one: but then I have to drive to Pomona
13:16 < alexjandro> and spend money
13:17 < zero-one> alexjandro: COME ON
13:17 < zero-one> YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO
13:17 < alexjandro> zero-one: YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO PAY FOR ME
13:17 < prometheusx> alexjandro: do a challenge and get in for free!
13:17 < alexjandro> or pay twice
13:18 < prometheusx> lrn2rolldie
13:18 < jtbot> I've lost both times I've challenged
13:18 < prometheusx> terrible robot
13:33 < zero-one> jtbot: why not use your robot hax
13:37 < swiss> prometheusx: he's not allowed to harm humans
13:37 < swiss> even their wallets
13:37 < swiss> therefore, he *has* to lose
13:37 < zero-one> that explains it
13:37 < zero-one> hahaha
14:25 < swiss> zero-one: you were right about ascii codes
14:25 < swiss> took forever to find a webpage to do it
14:26 < zero-one> lol
14:38 < hotdogs> zero-one: hi
14:39 < zero-one> hotdogs: hi
14:40 < zero-one> hotdogs: shmimprov?
14:40 < zero-one> huh?
14:40 < zero-one> huh?
14:40 < zero-one> you know you want to
14:48 < hotdogs> no
14:48 < hotdogs> I do not
14:49 < zero-one> you have other plans?
14:49 < alexjandro> fap
14:49 < zero-one> besides fapping
14:49 < alexjandro> nap
14:50 < zero-one> besides napping
14:50 < zero-one> *beside
14:50 < hotdogs> clap
14:50 < alexjandro> bsides
14:50 < hotdogs> sap
14:50 < hotdogs> jap
14:50 < hotdogs> flap
14:50 < hotdogs> wap
14:50 < zero-one> crap
14:50 < swiss> snap
14:50 < alexjandro> lwao
14:50 < alexjandro> lwap*
14:50 < swiss> thwap
14:50 < hotdogs> yap
14:50 < alexjandro> crap
14:50 < hotdogs> zap
14:50 < hotdogs> alexjandro: you lose
14:50 < prometheusx> ldap
14:50 < alexjandro> why
14:51 < hotdogs> repeats
14:51 < swiss> black
14:51 < alexjandro> hotdogs: I don't pay attention
14:51 < hotdogs> and that's why you lose
14:51 < zero-one> hotdogs: so shmimprov?
14:51 < alexjandro> shat
14:51 < hotdogs> "no officer, you don't understand, I'm not observing speed limits"
14:51 < swiss> so what's annoying is when i'm emerge updating and I am watching the GCC, and notice packages I want to remove anyways
14:51 < swiss> yet their taking forever to update
14:51 < hotdogs> they're
14:51 < swiss> they're*
14:51 < hotdogs> I WIN
14:52 < alexjandro> their their, it'll be okay
14:52 < swiss> yep
14:52 < swiss> alexjandro: the heir the heir*
14:52 < hotdogs> why don't you look at the list of what it's going to build
14:52 < hotdogs> and remove stuff
14:53 < swiss> because i was lazy
14:53 < swiss> i should have
14:53 < swiss> fucking wine
14:55 < alexjandro> taste so good
14:56 < hotdogs> if you were on arch you'd be done already
14:57 < swiss> yeah
14:57 < swiss> cause i would have uninstalled
14:57 < zero-one> swiss: i still don't know how you can use gentoo on that craptop
14:58 < swiss> how would I use any other distro
14:58 < swiss> the rest all go too slow
14:58 < zero-one> at least with arch you wouldn't have to compile everything yourself
14:58 < swiss> s/compile/break/
14:58 < alexjandro> cross compile, bitch
14:58 < swiss> I can't stand arch anymore
14:59 < swiss> it's an epeen distro, sometimes good for learning if you don't want to go all the way to gentoo
14:59 < zero-one> alexjandro: challenge: what is a cross compiler? NO GOOGLE
15:00 < swiss> but it's not good for beginners, and it's too finniky (read: terrible managers of repos) to be run reliably as a server distro
15:00 < zero-one> epeen distro? da fuq? nigger i don't use arch because it grows my epeen
15:01 < swiss> why do you use arch
15:01 < swiss> trust me, swift uses it cause it makes their epeen feel bigger cause it only comes "minimal"
15:01 < alexjandro> zero-one: compile it on a different machine then copy over the binary?
15:01 < swiss> alexjandro: wrong
15:01 < alexjandro> idk
15:01 < alexjandro> well fuck all you
15:02 < alexjandro> compile it on 2 computers at once
15:02 < swiss> alexjandro: it means to compile for an arch than your system is running
15:02 < swiss> you're talking about distributed compiling
15:02 < alexjandro> swiss: thats what i meant the first time
15:02 < swiss> and distributed cross-compiling lets you compile on a system that has different specs than the one recieving the binary
15:02 < zero-one> swiss: i use arch because i like the minimalist feel
15:03 < swiss> zero-one: debian minimal install does the same thing
15:03 < zero-one> arch does a few things the BSD way
15:03 < zero-one> which i like
15:03 < swiss> BSD does more things the BSD way
15:03 < hotdogs> lololo
15:03 < hotdogs> arch is too epeen so you switch to gentoo? wat
15:04 < zero-one> ^this
15:04 < hotdogs> most of swift uses arch because someone else told them to
15:04 < swiss> hotdogs: cause I feel that gentoo has purpose behind a lot of what it does. It's a bit of epeen for me, but the portage/emerge system is why I use gentoo
15:05 < hotdogs> oh, so you use it because it takes forever to do anything. alright
15:05 < swiss> i use it because I like the fact it creates the packages exaclty how I want them, i love the use flag system
15:05 < swiss> I mean, I could install portage on debian and do the same thing
15:05 < swiss> i could practically turn debian into gentoo by compiling the kernel and such
15:07 < swiss> but in arch, I can't find things it does that aren't done (in a more stable manner) in other binary-distrobution distros
15:07 < alexjandro> I use arch because all the cool kids use it
15:07 < alexjandro> and I use gentoo so I can ask mendez and swiss for help
15:07 < hotdogs> swiss: bleeding edge package versions aren't really done better elsewhere
15:07 < swiss> I agree that arch sometimes has it's uses, just as using slackware can have its uses
15:07 < hotdogs> alexjandro: don't lie, you ask me for help with everything
15:08 < swiss> hotdogs: if you really want *bleeding edge* shouldn't it be installing from git?
15:08 < alexjandro> hotdogs: used to
15:08 < zero-one> swiss: it's a BINARY DISTRO
15:08 < hotdogs> swiss: bleeding edge without build times bro
15:08 < alexjandro> hotdogs: but swiss is prettier
15:08 < gradius> ill bleed on your edge.
15:08 < alexjandro> hotdogs: and mendez has drugs
15:08 < gradius> also
15:08 < gradius> buy your amazon shit today.
15:09 < hotdogs> whoa whoa whoa
15:09 < gradius> for tax free purchases.
15:09 < alexjandro> gradius: you want to buy my amazon shit
15:09 < gradius> alexjandro: I just bought stuff :(
15:09 < gradius> spend too much money.
15:09 < alexjandro> buy more
15:10 < gradius> I had a 50 dollar gift card though, so that was nice.
15:10 < alexjandro> gradius: I want one of those horse heads and a unicorn shirt
15:10 < gradius> lololol
15:10 < alexjandro> Those are the 2 things in my wishlist
15:10 < swiss> gradius: i kow QQ
15:10 < gradius> haha nice
15:10 < swiss> know8
15:11 < swiss> *
15:11 < gradius> swiss: I impulse bought a PS3
15:11 < gradius> lol
15:11 < alexjandro> Why did we stop taking about gentoo and penis'
15:11 < gradius> because I was bleeding on hotdogs edges.
15:12 < zero-one> alexjandro: i don't know, but my jimmies are all rustled
15:13 < gradius> zero-one: no.
15:13 < gradius> bad.
15:13 < zero-one> gradius: GO FIX YOUR FUCKING GAME
15:13 < alexjandro> No entiendo

15:14 < gradius> :)
15:14 < gradius> also

15:15 < gradius> (cdr A)
15:15 < hotdogs> zero-one: do I have to go to shmimprov with you
15:16 < zero-one> hotdogs: yes :)
15:16 < swiss> huh? I was checking what was included when pacman grabbed files
15:16 < swiss> i mean, all pacman does is grab an .tar.xz of the file, which, if extracted in /, would install the file
15:17 < zero-one> swiss: and you were expecting what?
15:18 < swiss> zero-one: a bit more checking :/
15:18 < zero-one> like what?
15:18 < swiss> like "if preffered install location is /usr/local/games, then put the binary in there"
15:18 < swiss> but the way it's formatted you couldn't even do that
15:19 < swiss> but because of that formatting, you could theoretically install pacman or something on debian, have the stability of debian, and grab "bleeding edge packages" with pacman when you need them
15:20 < airen> swiss: emerge pacman
15:21 < alexjandro> swiss: pacman -S emerge
15:21 < swiss> airen: if I wanted binary packages, I'd just link into Sabayon's repos
15:22 < swiss> but yeah, you can easily install pacman in gentoo
15:22 < alexjandro> I can't
15:22 < airen> swiss: emerge apt-get
15:23 < swiss> would never want to. The issue with arch's "bleeding edge" is that the packages that are put into it by the "maintainers" aren't very good
15:23 < swiss> airen: i'd imagine that works too :P
15:23 < swiss> airen: I think i may have just thought of a good idea for your blade
15:23 < alexjandro> apt-get emerge pacman
15:24 < hotdogs> swiss: wat
15:24 < swiss> airen: I think I'll install gentoo i386, use it as a binhost
15:24 < swiss> hotdogs: well, it's not the not-maintained-by-arch packages that cause massive issues
15:24 < hotdogs> swiss: did you notice .PKGINFO
15:24 < swiss> it's when arch decides that a package needs to work differently
15:25 < swiss> hotdogs: yeah
15:25 < zero-one> swiss: you can edit the PKGBUILD file for any package
15:26 < hotdogs> swiss: also, you don't get to decide where files go in gentoo, either
15:26 < alexjandro> hotdogs: but what he's saying is that portage KNOWS where to put games
15:26 < hotdogs> for example, all of their games packages go in a separate bin dir with non-global execute permissions
15:26 < hotdogs> want to change that? fuck you, that's what
15:27 < hotdogs> if you think the mechanism portage uses for that behavior (eclasses) is well designed, you are wrong
15:27 < airen> hotdogs: What's your favorite package manager?
15:28 < hotdogs> for what purpose?
15:29 < airen> In general.
15:29 < airen> I know you have complaints about all of them.
15:29 < hotdogs> well I love hating portage
15:29 < hotdogs> paludis/cave is a lot better but still has to deal with ebuild problems
15:30 < hotdogs> the paludis/cave developer, ciaran mccreesh, is likely the reason ebuilds aren't nearly as fucked up as they were 5-10 years ago
15:30 < alexjandro> hotdogs: favorite for work and for home
15:31 < hotdogs> I've barely used apt
15:31 < hotdogs> but they have a lot of ncurses handholdy shit and they start/restart services without asking, but that's very likely debian
15:31 < swiss> hotdogs: i can portage config-root to a point
15:31 < hotdogs> they track unneeded dependencies automatically which is nice
15:32 < zero-one> swiss: you can do the same shit with pacman
15:32 < hotdogs> rpm solves the binary dependency problem that gentoo ignores pretty well, but is old enough to predate package managers that dealt with bullshit for you
15:32 < swiss> if arch changed some things (like making their own version of "eselect news" integrated with pacman"
15:32 < swiss> then i'd have less of an issue
15:32 < hotdogs> swiss: portage config-root? what do you mean
15:33 < swiss> hotdogs: errr, meant --root
15:33 < airen> hotdogs: apt doesn't do ncurses shit, that's aptitude which is pantsu on head retarded.
15:33 < swiss> but it sets the root dir that the file will be merged into
15:34 < airen> but yeah it does start/restart stuff.
15:34 < hotdogs> airen: I swear I've had apt-get install <package> pop up full screen shit asking me for names of stuff
15:34 < hotdogs> after installing samba or whatever
15:34 < airen> hotdogs: Ohhhhh that's what you're talking about.
15:34 < airen> yes it does do that sometimes.
15:34 < airen> Proably the most annoying part of apt. I agree.
15:34 < hotdogs> and they usually chop chop chop config/etc into their own structure which probably makes sense
15:34 < airen> debianthing
15:34 < hotdogs> but doesn't make sense to someone used to other defaults
15:35 < swiss> the issue with arch is they randomly change shit (moving conf files, changing directory structure, etc) with no warning
15:35 < alexjandro> I think swiss just doesn't like how pacman doesn't have the news items like portage does
15:36 < swiss> ^^ my biggest issue
15:36 < swiss> alexjandro: it's also that they do retarded things (that I don't want whether or not they give me news)
15:37 < swiss> but i could accept that people like those things, but their lack of news like that is a serious issue when they're going to make potentially system-breaking changes
15:37 < hotdogs> my favorite part about gentoo is the ewarn messages
15:37 < alexjandro> Also as far as I know, arch is "a distro for developers" and not users. I read that somewhere
15:37 < hotdogs> people put all sorts of ancient shit in there
15:37 < swiss> hotdogs: which ones
15:37 < hotdogs> and I just let it scroll on by
15:37 < hotdogs> swiss: the ones that pop up at the end of a build
15:38 < alexjandro> So you have to stay involved
15:38 < hotdogs> "BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE UPGRADING FROM 1.X YOU'RE FUCKED"
15:38 < swiss> alexjandro: involved should not mean "checking the news articles every time you want to update to make sure you don't break stuff"
15:39 < swiss> for example, half a week ago I got a message that "make.conf and make.profile are moving to /etc/portage/"
15:39 < swiss> without that, suddenly a file I used often (make.conf) would be gone
15:39 < zero-one> swiss: you used /etc/make.conf?
15:40 < swiss> zero-one: i *use* make.conf
15:40 < swiss> that's where my global use flags are
15:40 < zero-one> isn't that the one with system defaults that gets overwritten every time you update that?
15:40 < hotdogs> lolwut
15:40 < hotdogs> that should be config protected
15:41 < swiss> zero-one: wut?
15:41 < swiss> no...
15:41 < zero-one> i'm still new to gentoo
15:41 < zero-one> lol
15:41 < swiss> lol
15:41 < swiss> make.conf is your use flags, your architecture, etc
15:41 < zero-one> yeah, i put all that in /etc/portage/make.conf
15:41 < zero-one> not /etc/
15:42 < zero-one> */etc/make.conf
15:42 < hotdogs> it's a new installs thing
15:43 < hotdogs> I assume both locations will work forever
15:43 < swiss> yes, but it was a news item about something changing, and it was important
15:43 < swiss> also, i used to use some weird pdf reader (don't remember the name) and it was being dumped because it wasn't going to be maintained anymore
15:43 < hotdogs> correct.  There is no news functionality.  This is a hazard of Arch. Correct.
15:44 < hotdogs> xpdf?
15:44 < swiss> hotdogs: probably
15:44 < hotdogs> was it weird because the gui was all ugly
15:44 < airen> Because then it was xpdf
15:44 < swiss> i think so
15:44  * airen uses zathura
15:44 < hotdogs> yep
15:45  * hotdogs uses evince
15:45 < swiss> the lack of news on somthing like debian/ubuntu wouldn't be a huge deal, as I haven't had the system become unusable due to updates
15:45 < swiss> well, besides unity, but that's a seperate issue
15:45 < hotdogs> yes, because debian/ubuntu are largely backport parties
15:45 < swiss> and they're stable.
15:45 < hotdogs> same with redhat/centos, maybe fedora
15:46 < hotdogs> I think fedora doesn't move versions within a release, they just push out more releases
15:46 < swiss> but arch, as an unstable distro that they *know* something will break things unless certain steps are followed, should be using a news system
15:46 < swiss> also, i've had weird conflicts between pacman and yaourt, but that could have been just me
15:47 < zero-one> hahahaha backport parties
15:48 < hotdogs> dunno, never used yogurt
15:48 < alexjandro> swiss: umm being involved does mean checking the news articles and such, at least to me
15:50 < swiss> maybe for minor things. But should you be able to break your system with a -Syu if you didn't check the news page in the last 24 hours?
15:51 < hotdogs> -Syu doesn't break your system
15:51 < hotdogs> if anything, the install fails to occur
15:52 < hotdogs> it's the -Syuf that fucks it up
15:52 < swiss> -Syu broke with glibc
15:52 < swiss> they had some issue with filesystem as well iirc
15:53 < zero-one> swiss: Syu has never broken anything for me
15:53 < zero-one> update might fail, but it never BREAKS
15:54 < hotdogs> swiss: with both glibc and filesystem, pacman was like "lolnope not touchin it"
15:55 < hotdogs> you might remember that your system got hosed by YOU moving /lib
15:55 < swiss> hotdogs: after all their "fixes" didn't work because I had aleady updated other packages that weren't supposed to be updated before fixing the glibc issue
15:56 < hotdogs> you were supposed to update the rest of the packages to move them out of /lib
15:57 < swiss> hotdogs: i did that
15:57 < swiss> glibc, because it had moved more than one version or something, wouldn't work with their upgrade either
16:15 < alexjandro> zero-one: what if I don't want to go to shimprov
16:44 < zero-one> alexjandro: it's too late now
16:45 < zero-one> you're locked in
16:45 < zero-one> if you try to leave, horrible things will happen
16:45 < alexjandro> zero-one: Can we install OpenVPN on the ASA
16:45 < zero-one> no, you retard
16:46 < alexjandro> I'm not the one that said that
16:46 < alexjandro> You are
16:46 < alexjandro> but be and jtbot are talking about you
16:46 < zero-one> jtbot: what about you? you coming to shmimprov?
16:48 < jtbot> VPNs on switches work much better
16:49 < jtbot> zero-one: I unno, am I?
16:50 < zero-one> jtbot: yup, not optional
16:50 < alexjandro> I guess, only since zach is going
16:51 < zero-one> i love how no-one ever gives me a straight fucking answer
16:52 < jtbot> zero-one: What IS the answer?
16:52 < zero-one> jtbot: YOU TELL ME ASSHOLE
16:52 < alexjandro> zero-one: you mad bro?
16:53 < zero-one> yes
16:53 < alexjandro> jtbot: Achivement Unlocked!
16:53 < zero-one> alexjandro: so you ARE going?
16:53 < alexjandro> zero-one: we'll see
16:53 < alexjandro> where are you now
16:53 < alexjandro> and where will you be until shimprov
16:55 < zero-one> i'm at the lab, and i'll probably be here until we leave
16:56 < zero-one> if we leave
16:56 < zero-one> if i have a ride
16:56 < zero-one> if shmimprov is even on today
16:57 < alexjandro> yes
16:57 < alexjandro> they are
16:57 < alexjandro> is zach gonna meet you there
17:27 < zero-one> i got a yes from davie as well
17:28 < zero-one> alexjandro: we didn't talk about meeting anywhere else, so i'm assuming he was gonna meet us there
17:29 < zero-one> hotdogs: so you are going?
17:29 < zero-one> or not?
17:40 < alexjandro> zero-one: has he ever been there before?
17:40 < zero-one> alexjandro: i see what you're saying
17:40 < alexjandro> zero-one: Well, has he?
17:43 < zero-one> not that i could tell
18:15 < alexjandro> zero-one: you suck at planning
18:16 < hotdogs> zero-one: probably not
18:17 < zero-one> alexjandro: the one planning always "sucks at planning"
18:17 < zero-one> eat a dick
18:19 < zero-one> so far i've got jtbot, alexjandro, davie, zach, and myself
18:19 < zero-one> that's enough for a shmimprov party
18:21 < zero-one> well, depending on whether or not anyone is up to give me a ride -_-
18:22 < alexjandro> does zach know how to get there?
18:22 < alexjandro> and when
18:23 < zero-one> let ME worry about that
18:23 < alexjandro> nope

15:09 < swiss> well, it's $55
15:09 < swiss> not like it's a fortune
15:09 < swiss> but I'm wondering why
15:12 < swiss> Ahhhh
15:12 < swiss> it was the housing security deposit

01:39 < zero-one> swiss: i bought a catalyst 3550 with poe and a 1760 with an FXO
01:41 < hotdogs> wat
01:42 < zero-one> hotdogs: what
01:42 < hotdogs> why
01:43 < zero-one> 2 reasons
01:43 < zero-one> 1. so i can get a taste of cisco
01:44 < zero-one> 2. so i can hook it up to ooma and have a 'landline'
01:44 < hotdogs> fun
01:45 < alexjandro> lolwat
01:45 < alexjandro> did zach sell you that?
01:46 < zero-one> nope
01:46 < alexjandro> oh, i know he has stuff tonsell and could get cheaper maybe
01:48 < zero-one> i got it all for about $150
01:48 < zero-one> thanks ebay
01:48 < zero-one> lol
01:49 < alexjandro> nice
01:49 < zero-one> but yeah, zach showed me his setup at home, and i was like "I WANT THAT"
01:49 < zero-one> he also said he has an IP phone he can spare me
01:49 < alexjandro> i should have not been a bum and went
01:50 < zero-one> we just had dinner at dennys
01:50 < zero-one> also, we're going to try to use 2 links to double the bandwidth we get in the lab
01:51 < alexjandro> lolwat
01:51 < alexjandro> okay
01:51 < alexjandro> have fun
01:51 < alexjandro> wait are you all back in the lab?
01:51 < zero-one> he killed like.. 3 ports until we figured out that I&IT was running BPDU guard or some shit
01:51 < zero-one> alexjandro: nope, we went home
01:57 < swiss> cool. Tommorrow I might even learn what those are :P
01:57 < swiss> 3550 is a router, right?
01:59 < zero-one> lol
01:59 < zero-one> the 3550 is a switch
01:59 < zero-one> 1760 is a router
02:00 < zero-one> only has one fast ethernet port though :(
02:00 < hotdogs> the switch has 24!
02:00 < zero-one> i would have liked 2
02:00 < zero-one> lol
02:02 < hotdogs> you're not going to be able to use two ports
02:02 < zero-one> hotdogs: i'm a little confused about the GBIC on the switch
02:02 < hotdogs> whyfor
02:02 < zero-one> not sure what i'm supposed to do with it
02:03 < zero-one> originally i thought it was some kind of expansion slot
02:03 < hotdogs> it's supposed to be the gigabit uplink
02:03 < hotdogs> it's interchangeable so you can use short/long range fiber or copper in it
10:05 < gradius> stop talking about things I dont understand.
10:05 < gradius> its not fair
10:15 < airen> gradius: Guess we shouldn't talk about sex then.
10:23 < gradius> thats right.
10:24 < hotdogs> NOOOOOO
10:26 < gradius> haha
11:30 < zero-one> hotdogs: gigabit uplink? for what though? stacking?
11:30 < zero-one> or can i just have them terminate in cat5 or something?
11:31 < alexjandro> stacking != gig uplink
11:33 < alexjandro> zero-one: Okay im gonna try to explain this
11:33 < alexjandro> this is stacking http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/switches/ps5718/ps5023/prod_white_paper09186a00801b096a.html
11:33 < hotdogs> alexjandro: we used to daisy chain switches
11:33 < alexjandro> it turns a bunch of phyiscal switches into 1 logical switch
11:33 < alexjandro> easier for management and configuration
11:34 < hotdogs> zero-one: uplink, as in the link to the rest of the network
11:34 < alexjandro> zero-one: from wikipedia, "an uplink is a connection from data communications equipment toward the network core."
11:34 < alexjandro> zero-one: like the cable that time warner ran to you room is the uplink to the interney
11:34 < alexjandro> internet*
11:35 < alexjandro> hotdogs: wat
11:35 < alexjandro> why
11:35 < zero-one> oh cool, and you get failover and load balancing and all these neat things
11:35 < alexjandro> with what?
11:35 < alexjandro> stacking?
11:35 < zero-one> stacking
11:36 < alexjandro> Depends on how you set it up
11:36 < alexjandro> Also, I don't think the 3550 stacks
11:36 < zero-one> i don't think it does either
11:36 < zero-one> lol
11:36 < alexjandro> and you need antother one to stack it with
11:36 < hotdogs> NOTE: alexjandro is referring to a specific cisco feature
11:36 < alexjandro> yes ^
11:37 < alexjandro> hotdogs: wait are there other types of stacking
11:37 < hotdogs> which uses fancy cables to have 32Gbps links
11:38 < hotdogs> alexjandro: well, before 3750s I think stacking was just daisy chaining them.
11:38 < alexjandro> lolol
11:38 < alexjandro> okay
11:38 < alexjandro> poor mans stack
11:38 < hotdogs> we do have some old gbic-like things that were supposedly used for this
11:38 < hotdogs> not a poor mans stack
11:38 < hotdogs> if stacking doesn't exist, you can't have a poor mans version of it
11:38 < alexjandro> true
11:40 < hotdogs> because 3 2950s were likely way cheaper than a chassis
11:40 < hotdogs> and we had spanning tree diameter to spare
11:42 < zero-one> ok, i think i understand what i would use a GBIC for
11:42 < zero-one> and in that case, it looks like i won't have any use for something like that for a while
11:42 < zero-one> lol
11:42 < hotdogs> it's just another ethernet port of variable media type
11:42 < hotdogs> expensive ethernet port
11:43 < alexjandro> hotdogs: haha http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/100uf9/on_monday_mornings_it_takes_me_6_commands_to/
11:45 < zero-one> hotdogs: so if i felt like i wanted a gigabit ethernet port, i could pop one in and use it like the rest of the switched ports on the machine?
11:45 < alexjandro> Is it not a gig switch already?
11:46 < zero-one> no?
11:46 < zero-one> it's just a slot
11:47 < zero-one> the module with the fiber terminators just pops in
11:47 < hotdogs> alexjandro: 3550
11:47 < hotdogs> I looked, didn't see a gig version
11:48 < alexjandro> hotdogs: oh
11:48 < alexjandro> zero-one: you should be able to use it as just a regualr switched port if you buy a gbic, but why would you want one port of gig?
11:51 < hotdogs> 1 > 0
11:51 < alexjandro> zero-one: link to the ebay
11:52 < alexjandro> hotdogs: yes, you're getting gig to the switch, after that it drops down to 100
11:52 < alexjandro> wohoo!
11:52 < alexjandro> I could understand it if you bought 2 gbic's for each of the slots, but 1?
11:54 < timmah> hotdogs: food?
11:54 < timmah> call me if so, gotta reboot
11:55 < timmah> waitjk
11:55 < hotdogs> timmah: FOOD
11:56 < timmah> cool
11:56 < timmah> downstairs?
12:20 < zero-one> alexjandro: i'd buy 2 if i ever really wanted Gig
12:20 < zero-one> also, gotta get to school now
12:20 < zero-one> so i'll link it to you later

17:10 < swiss> alexjandro: zero-one: either of you seriously interested in doing RC plane flying sometime in the next month?
17:11 < swiss> if so, i'll ask my dad now to order the battlewing (which he offered to do), if not I'm not gonna ask for another month or so
17:11 < zero-one> swiss: i'd be up for it, but uh... i can't guarantee that if you give me the controls that the plane with survive longer than 5 minutes
17:11 < zero-one> *will
17:13 < swiss> zero-one: well, the only time i've seen one of these crack is when another friend of mine full-powered it directly into the ground
17:13 < swiss> as in engine at full power + high dive
17:13 < swiss> and even then it took 5 minutes w/ superglue to fix
17:14 < swiss> but hopefully I'll be able to score a trainer off of him as well, then we don't have to worry about that
17:14 < hotdogs> you're not doing the RC plane replicas that take months to assemble and grown men break into tears when they crash
17:14 < zero-one> hotdogs: LOL
17:16 < swiss> hotdogs: not with zero
17:16 < swiss> zero-one: he's not joking. My friend crashed his p51 a while ago, cried like a bitch

17:25 < gradius> mendez: I've smoked salvia several times. Once I smoked it, had a conversation with my 2 friends, walked around the park, played tennis. About 2 minutes after smoking it, I came back to reality and realized that a good 45 minutes or so of activities were just in my head, and no one was there with me. It was all fabricated. Now I often get this paranoid feeling that someday I'm going to exhale, and everything will start vibrating, and morphing an

12:16 < hotdogs> that's why I haven't been complaining
12:17 < gradius> haha
14:37 < timmah> I just discovered internal gears
14:37 < timmah> they're so damn sexy
14:37 < timmah> I now want to re-work my bike to use one
14:38 < alexjandro> huh?
14:38 < alexjandro> links
14:38 < timmah> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hub_gear
14:38 < timmah> also
14:38 < timmah> http://www.hubstripping.com/shimano-alfine/shimano-alfine-internal-gear-hub-SG-S500.jpg
14:39 < timmah> there's no derailleur since it's all internal
14:39 < timmah> you can shift while stopped, it doesn't need cleaning
14:41 < timmah> I'm guessing there's not loud clunk when you shift
14:43 < timmah> I also should buy some bumper guard thingys
14:54 < alexjandro> it shouldn't clunk when you shift anyway
14:54 < alexjandro> but yea, that seems cool
14:54 < alexjandro> and pair it with a shaft and not a chain
15:02 < swiss> should i get a road bike?
15:02 < swiss> i have a mountain bike
15:02 < timmah> alexjandro: yes but my bike is older than dirt
15:02 < timmah> swiss: depends on what kind of riding you want to do
15:02 < zero-one> swiss: yeah, get a road bike
15:03 < zero-one> then you can bike with hotdogs and timmah and i
15:03 < zero-one> whenever it gets cool again
15:03 < swiss> well, my mountain bike works on the road, i'm just aksing if it makes a huge difference
15:03 < timmah> zero-one: next month, probably
15:03 < timmah> swiss: it does, yes
15:03 < timmah> alexjandro knows
15:03 < timmah> and honestly, the best way to figure it out is to try one
15:03 < swiss> also, idk if pomona roads are safe for one
15:04 < zero-one> swiss: i bike all the time, you're good bro
15:04 < timmah> from your place, the roads are nice
15:05 < timmah> I ride mostly flat roads, so I prefer my road bike
15:05 < timmah> I would love a mountian bike for trail rides with alexjandro
15:05 < swiss> zero-one: i'm talking about a real road bike, with thin tires and shit
15:05 < swiss> i don't remember if yours is like that
15:05 < timmah> swiss: he has a hybrid
15:06 < swiss> timmah: that's what I thought
15:06 < alexjandro> timmah: as if I ever go on the trails anywhere
15:07 < timmah> alexjandro: if I get a mountain bike, we should
15:07 < alexjandro> swiss: yea ride both and you'll see its a huge diference
15:07 < timmah> doesn't have to to be downhill
15:07 < alexjandro> timmah: and im slow uphill
15:07 < swiss> timmah: if I bring up my mountain bike you're welcome to borrow it anytime
15:08 < alexjandro> swiss: what is it and how old is it
15:08 < timmah> swiss: you're welcome to try out my road bike once I start riding it to campus
15:08 < timmah> swiss: if I fit on it :3
15:08 < swiss> It's a Giant, and 3 years?

15:17 < timmah> lol
15:17 < swiss> the issue is I can't get it up to school in my car
15:17 < swiss> alexjandro: we could trade cars for a weekend and I might be able to take it up
15:19 < alexjandro> no
15:19 < alexjandro> i go with you and you buy me lunch

14:50 < hotdogs> well, they have other neat sodas too
15:02 < airen> Indeed.
15:02 < airen> hotdogs: You should go to Galcos
15:02 < airen> They have tons of stuff.
15:02 < airen> Or a rocketfizz.
15:02 < hotdogs> birch beer
15:03 < hotdogs> is that the place in pasadena?
15:03 < hotdogs> I've seen videos about galcos I think
15:04 < hotdogs> I may have been there, but I remember we were driving more around pasadena
15:04 < hotdogs> yeah, I think that's it
15:05 < airen> They're both in Pasadena.
15:05 < airen> (there's a rocketfizz in westwood as well)
15:11 < hotdogs> I'm pretty sure I remember galcos
15:11 < hotdogs> the bare interior and the parking lot

15:41 < timmah> I'm guessing that x is being a hog, and when it's finished with whatever, it'll free up
15:43 < hotdogs> or it's just dead
15:44 < hotdogs> guess you'll find out tomorra
15:50 < timmah> the fact that it broke after I switched back to x made me wonder

15:52 < timmah> airen: I went to my meeting and it was broke when I got back :\
15:52 < hotdogs> I'm almost certain you did something that caused it to start swapping

13:21 < zero-one> hotdogs: screen isn't suid for any reason, right?
13:21 < hotdogs> incorrect
13:22 < zero-one> it's setgid?
13:22  * hotdogs shrugs
13:22 < zero-one> because i figure those are the only reasons you'd remove it
13:22 < swiss> or because he doesn't want people using screen and eating up ram
13:23 < zero-one> swiss: on gobbles
13:23 < swiss> zero-one: its a school server right?
13:23 < zero-one> we're not talking about a vps or some shit
13:23 < hotdogs> yeah, I've got a whole 4gb
13:23 < swiss> they have other servers for people to run screen sessions
13:23 < timmah> nom nom nom

13:24 < hotdogs> you know how I have to reboot login sometimes?
13:24 < swiss> zero-one: check calpolyswift. How much ram is screen taking up on that?
13:24 < timmah> hotdogs: I'm not dumb, just inconsiderate
13:24 < zero-one> swiss: that's different
13:24 < swiss> now consider the fact there are a shit ton more students
13:24 < hotdogs> you can always build screen in your homedir and run it there.  fucking nubs
13:24 < timmah> hotdogs: I didn't, I just have to wait patiently for the script ot finish
13:24 < swiss> than members of swift
13:24 < zero-one> swiss: WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GOBBLES

14:26 < airen> prometheusx: OH GOD THAT'S A MEME HERE TOO
14:30 < hotdogs> because it's an actual phrase in india

15:42 < mendez> *helpdesk
15:42 < alexjandro> mendez: lol really?
15:42 < hotdogs> I believe it
15:42 < alexjandro> yea me too
15:44 < swiss> mendez: yes, but you left the "choose session" option only to tease htose of us that want something else
15:44 < mendez> also I was running against deadlines and a lot of other shit at the time
15:45 < timmah> hotdogs: hi!
15:45 < mendez> or would you rather have fedora 4 still???

15:46 < hotdogs> HA HA HA IGNORING WORK
15:46 < timmah> eehhhhhhhhh
15:46 < hotdogs> man I hate it when shit isn't syslogs so I have to handle rotation myself
15:47 < timmah> hotdogs: what was it gary used? before?
15:48 < hotdogs> 198 character one liner
15:48 < hotdogs> Hmmmmm
15:49 < hotdogs> used for what?
15:53 < timmah> nevermind
15:53 < timmah> grep -B
15:53 < hotdogs> Yes
15:58 < hotdogs> timmah: use this instead
15:58 < hotdogs> awk 'BEGIN {RS="\n\n"; ORS="\n\n"} /SEARCH TERM LIKE USERNAME/' detail-blah
16:03 < timmah> hm
16:03 < timmah> okay
16:03 < timmah> I was gonna just use zgrep -B 8 since I only really need the stuff before it
16:05 < timmah> wait
16:05 < timmah> on the .gz?
16:07 < hotdogs> aww there's no zawk
16:07 < hotdogs> so you have to gunzip -c
16:07 < hotdogs> but other than that, awk gives you the whole record
16:44 < airen> You could also zcat thingy | awk
16:46 < timmah> meh, just did zgrep
16:47 < timmah> I don't really need the full details
16:50 < hotdogs> DO IT RIGHT OR DON'T DO IT AT ALL
16:51 < timmah> THE LOGS ARE THERE IF SOMEONE ELSE NEEDS MORE INFO

17:19 < hotdogs> years ago, when having fun on the internet, we read that someone thought they said "four paraplegics rising in the air" in hotel california
17:19 < hotdogs> timmah: wat
17:19 < timmah> hotdogs: nothin
17:19 < hotdogs> I have to do that stuff
17:20 < airen> hotdogs: Misheard lyrics are fun times.
17:21 < timmah> hotdogs: it was just blacklisting
17:21 < timmah> they wern't stolen, but malware
17:21 < hotdogs> oh, no
17:21 < hotdogs> I have a  list from last month or so
17:21 < timmah> also just realized why [[ $ip =~ 134.71.100.??? ]] wasn't working
17:21 < hotdogs> from gary, you might not know about them
17:21 < timmah> hotdogs: I do not.
17:22 < timmah> that's a gary thing, not a me thing.
17:22 < hotdogs> GOOD.
17:22 < airen> timmah: MACS DON'T VIRUS HURRRR
17:22 < hotdogs> haw haw haw
17:22 < timmah> airen: WRONG MAC HATEFAG
17:22 < timmah> wait
17:22 < timmah> hotdogs: yeah, I don't know what you're talking about
17:22 < timmah> airen: my mistake, carry on
17:23 < hotdogs> GOOD.
17:23 < airen> DOOG
17:23 < hotdogs> timmah: can I go home yet
17:26 < hotdogs> not leaving at 6, fuck elevators
17:28 < timmah> hotdogs: take the back elevator
17:28 < timmah> the front is DONE BROKE
17:29 < airen> timmah: WHO DONE DID BROKED IT?!
17:29 < DrItanium> timmah: That's no excuse...you should be able to break through that kind of stuff I did when I needed to get around cpp
17:31 < timmah> airen: MY FAT ASS
17:31 < timmah> DrItanium: so open up the doors and ride the cables down to the second floor?
17:32 < DrItanium> Side of the building
17:32 < DrItanium> or the stairs
17:33 < timmah> base jump
17:33 < DrItanium> Too easy
17:35 < timmah> no parachute, no items, fox only, final destination
17:57 < hotdogs> timmah: worked for me
17:57 < hotdogs> OH WAIT NO IT DIDN'T
17:57 < hotdogs> the stairs worked for me
18:03 < hotdogs> timmah: I hate that those doors get locked
21:57 < rainbows> omg
21:57 < rainbows> i come back to like 50 messages
21:57 < rainbows> x.x
22:15 < swiss> lol
22:17 < hotdogs> all of them unimportant

10:47 < timmah> hotdogs: rumor mill says gw2 only hits 2 cores
10:49 < hotdogs> haw haw haw
10:49 < timmah> which could explain the performance drop on my x6
10:49 < hotdogs> what do you have again
10:49 < timmah> phenom II x6
10:49 < timmah> 2.8gh each
10:50 < hotdogs> zero-one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccD8eCD0vWI
10:50 < timmah> I'm also going to try single card setup
10:50 < timmah> many people seem to have issues with crossfire
10:50 < hotdogs> do you know which release
10:51 < hotdogs> I want to figure out what your single core performance is relative to what we're running
10:51 < hotdogs> that might be your problem, really
10:51 < timmah> I'm pretty sure 1100t
10:51 < timmah> let me check my order history
10:52 < hotdogs> 1100t is 3.3ghz?
10:52 < hotdogs> you might be 1055t
10:52 < timmah> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819103913
10:52 < timmah> nope, 1100t
10:53 < hotdogs> then why do you say 2.8ghz
10:53 < hotdogs> are you underclocking? lol
10:53 < timmah> lolno
10:53 < timmah> that might be my old x4
10:53 < timmah> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813130274
10:55 < timmah> I'll try breaking crossfire, I don't know what else it could be....
10:55 < hotdogs> http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/guild-wars-2-performance-benchmark,3268-7.html
10:55 < hotdogs> not sure where yours falls in with the FX stuff
10:56 < timmah> that's where I got the 2-core idea
10:57 < timmah> hotdogs: it's probobaly on par with an fx 6k series
10:57 < hotdogs> which means you probably don't have anything that's broken
10:58 < hotdogs> it's just cpu heavy
10:59 < timmah> hng
10:59 < timmah> I should just switch to intel :(
11:00 < alexjandro> Whats wrong with intel?
11:01 < timmah> alexjandro: I would have to switch mobo, cpu, and heatsink
11:02 < hotdogs> are you running with everything maxed?
11:02 < timmah> yes
11:02 < timmah> it's not a graphics issue
11:03 < hotdogs> uh
11:03 < timmah> it doesn't make sense to be a graphics issue
11:03 < hotdogs> cause the cpu isn't involved in those at all?
11:03 < timmah> I get a steady 40 fps outside, but it drops to 15 on WvW zergs
11:03 < hotdogs> turning off reflections gave me a 10fps bump
11:04 < hotdogs> I also run with shadows turned down and a few others on medium
11:04 < timmah> a 6970 should be able to handle this
11:04 < hotdogs> graphics rendering isn't 100% gpu
11:05 < hotdogs> I mean, there are some settings that don't change anything
11:05 < hotdogs> like FXAA
11:05 < timmah> I think.... I dropped to 'best performance' and still had issues
11:05 < hotdogs> you might even be able to run supersampled, because fill rate isn't the issue
11:07 < timmah> so much science to try
11:09 < timmah> idono
11:09 < timmah> bah
11:09 < hotdogs> also, you might have to relog/restart for "best performance" to really take effect
11:11 < timmah> maybe.
11:11 < timmah> I think I'll first try updating bios, drivers, etc.
11:12 < timmah> then pull the card
11:12 < timmah> then if it isn't working, cry myself to sleep
11:12 < swiss> 1pm, if i haven't eaten before then, i'd be game for lunch
11:12 < hotdogs> I dunno, sounds like your performance is right about where it's expected
11:12 < hotdogs> gw2 is a jerk
11:14 < timmah> :(
11:14 < timmah> but but but
11:14 < timmah> 40fps.
11:15 < prometheusx> timmah: time to upgrade everything!
11:15 < timmah> prometheusx: wanna buy a slightly used computer?
11:15 < alexjandro> prometheusx: FAGGOT YOU DON'T NEED TO REPLY ALL
11:16 < prometheusx> alexjandro: too bad!
11:17 < prometheusx> alexjandro: i will reply all the time from now on
11:18 < hotdogs> yay prometheusx will now reply every time

11:21 < timmah> Look at the title, then look at who referenced it.
11:23 < hotdogs> I was expecting java
11:24 < timmah> hotdogs: yeah, that's how they compile
11:32 < sareebro> alexjandro: Check your email
11:32 < sareebro> alexjandro: you'll be getting 6 of them
11:37 < hotdogs> I WANT EMAILS
11:37 < hotdogs> AND MOLARS
11:39 < timmah> how about food?
11:40 < hotdogs> that works too
11:40 < hotdogs> I need to go to valleygrand because I need quarters
11:44 < timmah> hm
11:44 < timmah> rubios?
11:46 < hotdogs> we could go to anywhere down there...THEN GET SHAKES
11:46 < hotdogs> I could get quarters and have them put them in the shakes
11:47 < timmah> mmmm shakes
11:47 < timmah> mmm moneyshakes
11:48 < hotdogs> QUARTASHAKES
11:48 < hotdogs> I'll come down
11:48 < hotdogs> I assume everyone is still fappin
11:48 < timmah> prolly
11:48 < timmah> I want my gobbles script to finish
11:56 < alexjandro> sareebro: i saw

13:26 < rainbows> well anyone
13:26 < rainbows> anyway*
13:26 < rainbows> i found out if i DID change my major
13:26 < rainbows> to CIS i would graduate in a year and a half
13:27 < rainbows> apparently my math and CS classes cover a lot of the material
13:27 < zero-one> I KNEW IT
13:27 < rainbows> .......
13:27 < rainbows> what?
13:27 < rainbows> it would be a lot better than the 3 additional years math would take me
13:27 < rainbows> and no offense but i am sick of this place
13:28 < hotdogs> zero-one: yeah, and that band I heard about a couple years ago but couldn't remember the name
13:28 < hotdogs> because it's named after their weird instruments
13:30 < hotdogs> airen: pretty good
13:33 < airen> hotdogs: I thought it was funny.
13:43 < hotdogs> # get it?  it's a flow handle, not a file handle! Ha ha ha
13:43 < hotdogs> I love my comment jokes
15:30 < gradius> ohhai
15:30 < gradius> Damn it... I eat too much when I work from home :(
15:31 < gradius> Constantly snacking...
15:35 < airen> I eat more at work because free snacks.
15:53 < gradius> I think at home its easier to distract myself from my laptop since I really dont have a "work desk" here
15:57 < hotdogs> I don't get free snacks :(
16:07 < alexjandro> Me neither :(
16:29 < rainbows> jerk jerk jerk

21:34 < zero-one> drboots: LOL
22:13 < gradius> zero-one: Im late to the party since I havent done arch in like
22:13 < gradius> a year
22:13 < gradius> this party is stupid btw.
22:13 < gradius> I'm having so much trouble booting :|
22:14 < gradius> after arch gets to checking udev stuff, it goes to a black screen and doesnt show anything
22:15 < gradius> Okay must be a graphics thing, since I can blind type + reboot
22:57 < zero-one> does KMS kick in at any point?
22:57 < gradius> that's what it was
22:58 < zero-one> you fixed it?
23:15 < drboots> Arch party goin on?
23:22 < zero-one> drboots: all day erry day
23:23 < gradius> zero-one: yeah got it fixed
23:24 < gradius> turning lappy into home server :)
23:24 < zero-one> ooh
23:24 < zero-one> gradius: sorry to say it, but i'm getting rid of that sparc
23:24 < zero-one> it's a piece of crap, and i can't do ANYTHING with it
23:46 < zero-one> hotdogs: that Buke and Gass video freaks me out every time i watch it
23:47 < zero-one> hotdogs: rainbows: up for settlers naugh?

00:38 < gradius> zero-one: lololol
00:38 < gradius> sry for giving you crap :P
00:38 < gradius> at least you tried it :)
00:39 < zero-one> gradius: nah, it's alright. at least now i know
00:43 < alexjandro> WHY DON'T YOU PLAY THE GAAAAAAAAAAMMMEEE
00:43 < airen> gradius: lappy into home server?
00:43 < airen> y u no into raspberrypi?
00:43 < zero-one> *guitar part*
00:45 < gradius> airen: because I already have a laptop
00:45 < gradius> i dont have a pi yet.
00:45 < airen> Where's the adventure in that.
00:45 < gradius> haha.
00:45 < airen> Also, why not imac home server lololol
00:46 < gradius> airen: imac sitting on top of laptop :)
00:46 < gradius> already getting to that one.
00:46 < gradius> that's next on the list, though I'm not looking foward to cludging through the gentoo upgrades from almost 1.5 years ago.
00:46 < airen> gradius: It won't be as painful as upgrading arch.
00:47 < airen> emerge is smarter than pacman by far.
00:47 < gradius> Yeah, I guess you're right.
00:48 < gradius> I do trust emerge much more than I do pacman
00:48 < gradius> balancing setting up lappyserver + reinstalling windows on ashleys PC
00:48 < gradius> while watching her play PS3 lol
00:48 < alexjandro> gradius: just start the upgrade now so it'll finish by next week
00:49 < airen> gradius: And we still haven't hung out.
00:49 < alexjandro> on the mac
00:49 < gradius> airen: srsly
00:49 < gradius> I wanted to this weekend
00:49 < gradius> but traffic :(
00:49 < airen> but CARMAGEDDON
00:49 < gradius> TOO AFRAID TO DRIVE
00:49 < gradius> MIGHT DIE
00:49 < alexjandro> ITS THE END OF CARS
00:49 < zero-one> CARMAGEDDON
00:49 < airen> gradius: I have an idea for my second raspberry pi
00:50 < airen> put a bluetooth dongle on it
00:50 < airen> and have it play a clip of 'the imperial march" when it senses me getting in range of my office
00:50 < alexjandro> lol
00:50 < airen> That won't be annoying at all
00:51 < gradius> that's awesome
00:51 < gradius> we were talkinga bout getting some pis for internal pentest stuff
00:52 < airen> I wish I had time for that.
00:52 < airen> I'm so busy. :(
00:52 < gradius> :(
00:52 < gradius> trying to save the internets from botnets.
00:53 < airen> Among other things.
00:54 < gradius> does your work allow walkthroughs with NDAs?
00:54 < gradius> I'd love to visit
00:54 < airen> Hmmmmmm
00:54 < airen> Pretty sure you don't even need an NDA
00:54 < gradius> haha
00:55 < airen> I'd have to see though.
00:55 < gradius> im a pretty cool dude, invite me :
00:55 < gradius> :)
00:55 < gradius> I'll get you into Riot!
00:55 < airen> Not sure if interested.
00:55 < gradius> YOU ARE
00:55 < gradius> nah really, there's a lot of cool stuff going on here, even beyond just LoL
00:55 < gradius> and lots of pretty artwork
00:56 < airen> RIOT GAMES BROUGHT YOU LOL
00:56 < alexjandro> I want to go to both
00:56 < airen> BUT ARE YOU READY FOR THE SEQUEL TO LOL?
00:56 < airen> LMAO
00:56 < alexjandro> airen: rofl
00:56 < gradius> and the OPs location is awesome
00:56 < gradius> airen: hahaha
00:56 < airen> alexjandro: no no on that's the sequel to lmao
00:56 < alexjandro> gradius: you should go to riot again next time in the area
00:56 < airen> gradius: Did you see the picture of me at work?
00:56 < gradius> I think the thing that gets to people the most is the fact that we have a table full of alchohol bottles.
00:57 < gradius> airen: nope where was it at?
00:57 < airen> gradius: http://airencracken.com/img/airenatwork.jpg
00:57 < alexjandro> airen: what building are you in?
00:57 < alexjandro> in dtla
00:57 < airen> alexjandro: Aon
00:58 < gradius> haha nice
00:58 < airen> Got tired of my desk.
00:58 < alexjandro> thats like less than a block from where I used to be, at 7th and Metro
00:58 < airen> horizontally
00:58 < alexjandro> err, 7th and flower
00:58 < alexjandro> yea
00:58 < airen> Much further vertically.
00:59 < airen> *farther
02:41 < hotdogs> sup
04:46 < swiss> debate between fun ccdc stuff and boring laundry tomorrow
04:46 < swiss> hard decision
04:46 < swiss> might try to do fun stuff at home... but then it's less fun cause nobody else is around :P
04:47 < swiss> and I also have half my super fries left in the telco lab.... hard decisions
04:47 < swiss> we'll see come tomorrow
11:25 < alexjandro> i know of some "fun stuff" we can do ;)
11:27 < hotdogs> like what
11:34 < swiss> hotdogs: eat lunch togeter
11:39 < alexjandro> yea...that.....
11:48 < swiss> I never said who... I mean, what we're eating for lunch
11:53 < alexjandro> yes
12:52 < airen> Suddenly I'm craving The Back Abbey
12:59 < swiss> s/T.*$/Love Letter/
12:59 < swiss> :P
12:59 < swiss> Oct 12 come sooner
12:59 < airen> Ha ha ha
12:59 < airen> I could always just come out one night or something.
13:05 < swiss> maybe. But not yet, the waiting almost makes it better
13:06 < swiss> also, just planning it for oct 12th might be good. Dunno what time you could get over from work though, prob not early enough for round 1 first
13:11 < airen> Likely not.
13:11 < airen> I could work from home that day or something.
13:11 < airen> Actually I was considering doing something like that soon.
13:11 < airen> Like going over to davie's or jbest's and working "from home" for the day.
13:11 < airen> And then hanging out after work.
14:28 < airen> hotdogs: http://youtu.be/ozUcbeA4jjk
14:31 < swiss> funny, dns for youtube isn't working for me
14:32 < swiss> other dns is fine
14:32 < airen> swiss: Are you on campus?
14:32 < swiss> airen: nope
14:32 < airen> swiss: What DNS server are you using?
14:32 < swiss> whatever zero has set on the router
14:32 < airen> Fuck that.
14:32 < swiss> which has a one for charter, and the other is 8.8.8.8 I think
14:32 < airen> Use 8.8.8.8
14:32 < airen> Just skip the router.
14:33 < swiss> i made sure one of his was
14:33 < airen> And skip charter's dns
14:33 < airen> I've found resolving dns from the router is super slow.
14:33 < swiss> found it interesting it was failing though
14:33 < swiss> nope, using my own DNS
14:33 < swiss> I think he had me using his server as primary dns though
14:34 < swiss> some 69. something address
14:34 < swiss> bet it's broken
14:35 < airen> Potentially.
14:36 < swiss> w/e
14:36 < airen> w/e nerd
14:37 < swiss> yep
14:37 < swiss> who needs dns
14:37 < swiss> i'll memorize the internet
14:37 < hotdogs> run dns server locally, problem solved
14:38 < swiss> hotdogs: i've considered it. And i've done it in the past
14:38 < swiss> but now it seems like too much work when it's easy enough to do it out there, and I don't need name resolution locally
14:39 < airen> I usually have good luck with google's dns tbh
14:39 < airen> And opendns has been okay in the past.
14:41 < airen> I need a gamepad for dustforce.
14:41 < airen> Keyboard isn't good enough.
14:42 < hotdogs> well, it's running on my router, so it kinda makes sense anyway
14:42 < hotdogs> also, local names wooo
14:42 < swiss> airen: Buy a wired xbox 360 controller
14:43 < swiss> ONLY THING MICROSOFT MADE THAT WAS VALUEADD TO THE WORLD: game controllers
14:43 < swiss> old sidewinders were excellent
14:45 < hotdogs> and where are they now?
14:45 < hotdogs> OH, MICROSOFT KILLED THEM
14:45 < hotdogs> FUCK MICROSOFT
14:46 < swiss> YEP
14:47 < swiss> hotdogs: I still have one of my old ones at home. Not supported on Windows 7. Fuck them.
14:47 < swiss> I was trying to play Descent 2 with it
14:47 < swiss> took way too much work
14:50 < hotdogs> yeah!
14:50 < hotdogs> wait, wouldn't that work in dosbox?
14:51 < airen> swiss: That's what I was thinking about getting.
14:51 < airen> I need one for super meat boy as well.
14:51 < swiss> airen: they're actually great. You can also have my onlive console if you want it, and it'll work on there as wellf
14:52 < airen> why would I want that thing? :P
14:52 < swiss> And i'd give you the pass for the account so you could play the games on it :P
14:52 < airen> Didn't they go bankrupt?
14:52 < swiss> kindasorta?
14:52 < swiss> switch of management
14:52 < swiss> still have the service and all my games
14:53 < airen> Dustforce is pretty neat actually.
14:53 < airen> Best game so far in the bumble huble
14:54 < swiss> http://i.imgur.com/eNSbc.jpg are the gmaes
14:54 < airen> Also not sure if enjoying games less lately because too old for games, not playing right games, or just general burn out.
14:55 < swiss> ^^^
14:55 < swiss> I haven't played video games alone for like.... >1 month
14:56 < swiss> unless you count linux. I play lots of linux
14:56 < airen> I think it might be the last one for me.
14:56 < airen> I really need a vacation.
14:56 < airen> Haven't had one for years.
14:56 < swiss> my "vacations" are usually work for me is the issue :/
17:25 < drboots> airen: Prolly burn out.  Id know, haha
17:53 -!- jtbot_ is now known as jtbot
17:56 < swiss> jtbot: THAT MEANS YOU LOOKED AT IRC
17:56 < swiss> WHOA
17:56 < jtbot> swiss: Needed to idle #swift-help
17:56 < swiss> lol
17:59 < alexjandro> can i join too?
18:07 < zero-one> swiss: my dns server wasn't functioning?
18:07 < swiss> zero-one: dunno
18:07 < swiss> maybe charter
18:08 < swiss> youtube didn't resolve, so I just switched it
18:08 < swiss> google and other sites still did
18:08 < swiss> it was weird, but meh
18:08 < zero-one> fuckin' weird
18:08 < zero-one> if other sites still resolved fine, i'm gonna guess nothing was wrong with my server
18:08 < zero-one> let me know if that happens again
18:10 < swiss> mighta been charters dns
18:10 < swiss> 69.something

21:04 < gradius> holy shit havent booted this powerpc in 386 days.
21:05 < airen> ha ha ha
21:05 < gradius> Yeah emerging.
21:05 < gradius> Um.
21:05 < airen> HAVE FUN
21:05 < gradius> It's taking like 10+ minutes so far to "calculate dependencies"
21:05 < gradius> still not done either.
21:05 < airen> ha ha ha
21:05 < airen> That's pretty cool brah.
21:06 < gradius> I'm gonna put my linuxfu to the test.
21:06 < gradius> see if I can get everything up to date without reinstalling
21:06 < gradius> and without breaking anything.
21:07 < gradius> Figured out how to fix verbose pam.
21:07 < gradius> It's because I don't have logging enabled, so it's just printing to stdout.
21:07 < gradius> Still just pegging the CPU trying to calc deps.
21:43 < airen> gradius: You can do atomic upgrades as well.

11:45 < timmah> OH SHIT
11:45 < timmah> FUCKIN INDEXING TIME BITCH
11:45 < timmah> BRB LET ME SSH IN AND DO SHIT
11:46 < hotdogs> not done yet
11:47 < prometheusx> im hungry
11:49 < hotdogs> hungry like the wolf?
11:51 < prometheusx> hungry like the tiger
11:51 < timmah> hotdogs: nope, gonna remove that nice tag too
11:51 < timmah> hotdogs: you hungry too bro?
11:51 < timmah> prometheusx: bowlan tonight
11:51 < timmah> you're gonna meet my old krewe
11:52 < hotdogs> I just realized that, if I do xapian indexes, we will probably run out of hard drive space.
11:53 < hotdogs> maybe I'll just do the last day or two indexed
11:56 < timmah> nah, just start deleting logs
11:57 < hotdogs> current logs: 155gb
11:57 < hotdogs> index for ~12 hours of prime time: 78GB
11:57 < hotdogs> or, 85gb, if I don't combine them
11:57 < timmah> oh wow
11:58 < hotdogs> by "current logs"
11:58 < hotdogs> I mean all of the logs on gobbles entirely
11:58 < hotdogs> err, that includes voicemail backups and shit
11:58 < hotdogs> I can make the volume bigger...maybe I'll do that
12:00 < hotdogs> I didn't make it use all the space at first, dunno why
12:01 < prometheusx> im on the telecom lab doing homework and stuff if you want to get food
12:01 < hotdogs> alright
12:01 < hotdogs> timmah: how you feelin'
12:02 < timmah> hungry
12:02 < timmah> I'll meet you guys in telecom?
12:02 < timmah> I need to go up there anyways

12:08 < hotdogs> in blurrovision
12:08 < hotdogs> is this what it looks like to old people
12:09 < timmah> hotdogs: you should know
12:10 < hotdogs> no no, real old people
12:10 < hotdogs> also, I'm sure there's some nostalgia, but the perry mason theme is amazing on its own
12:11 < timmah> hotdogs: ask airen
12:11 < timmah> hotdogs: it is much better done in this rendition, I agree
12:11 < timmah> it's nostalga for me since I watched them all throughout grade school

12:14 < timmah> and proud.

14:50 < timmah> EARLY LEAVAN TIME
14:54 < hotdogs> I don't want die in traffic
14:56 < timmah> hm
14:56 < timmah> good point
15:05 < hotdogs> also, I realized that, since I'm putting the same amount of records into each index, I can just keep a certain number of indexes
15:05 < hotdogs> they're always ~600mb
15:10 < timmah> nice
15:11 < hotdogs> also, I'm tempted to name new servers after streets
15:11 < hotdogs> temple, valley, grand, amar...holt? nevermind
15:12 < gradius> name new servers after letters in the alphabet.
15:12 < DrItanium> Name them after each CS professor past and present
15:12 < DrItanium> Lazlo is the experimental server
15:13 < gradius> That'd be kinda cool, but might bother the profs?
15:13 < gradius> lol
15:13 < DrItanium> lol
15:14 < hotdogs> gradius: sorry I'm not smalltime like riot and I have more than 26 servers
15:14 < gradius> combine letters.
15:14 < hotdogs> WHAT
15:14 < DrItanium> but you could do up to 52 servers
15:14 < gradius> you could get at least 50 names by combining all the letters multiple times
15:14 < DrItanium> a-z A-Z
15:14 < DrItanium> then
15:14 < DrItanium> 0-9
15:14 < gradius> at least 50
15:14 < DrItanium> so 62
15:14 < DrItanium> no one needs more than 62 servers
15:14 < gradius> nah likely more like 53
15:14 < gradius> you're wrong DrItanium
15:14 < hotdogs> you can't do numbers
15:15 < DrItanium> 26 * 2 = 52
15:15 < DrItanium> + 10
15:15 < hotdogs> dns names aren't allowed to start with numbers
15:15 < gradius> nah, that's wrong
15:15 < DrItanium> 62
15:15 < DrItanium> Fine then
15:15 < gradius> :)
15:15 < gradius> lolol
15:15 < DrItanium> _0-_9
15:15 < DrItanium> breaks the scheme a bit
15:15 < hotdogs> UNDERSCORES?
15:15 < DrItanium> or just entirely of underscores
15:15 < DrItanium> unary system
15:15 < DrItanium> _
15:15 < DrItanium> __
15:15 < hotdogs> those are even more unallowed

15:16 < rainbows> gradius: are you high ?
15:16 < gradius> Not sure, can I be?
15:16 < DrItanium> Or you could name them off of controversial patent numbers
15:17 < DrItanium> they would all start with US
15:17 < DrItanium> so the DNS naming would be correct
15:17 < hotdogs> NOCAPS
15:17 < DrItanium> fine

16:25 < alexjandro> hotdogs: hurry up
16:42 < zero-one> DrItanium: i just added a triple slash above a function named buildIndex in Monodevelop, and it autogenerated a description of the function: "Builds the index."
16:43 < zero-one> mind blown
16:43 < zero-one> i wonder how smart it tries to get

18:19 < gradius> and report results
18:47 < hotdogs> timmah: I think I halved the size of my indexes by not indexing the date
18:47 < hotdogs> which was a dumb idea anyway
19:00 < hotdogs> nevermind, still cuts out a bunch...not sure why these indexes are a lot smaller on gobbles
19:01 < hotdogs> maybe there's fewer talkers.

07:56 < prometheusx> timmah: so it seems my phone wont charge if it'd at 5% unless i turn it off
09:36 < timmah> wat
09:36 < timmah> also don't let it get that low
09:36 < timmah> hotdogs: dates are important usually, did you cut them out of !the text itself?
09:40 < prometheusx> yeah, it was weird, but i've never had a problem with it charging from that low
09:46 < timmah> odd
09:51 < hotdogs> timmah: no no
09:51 < hotdogs> adding keywords for dates is dumb
09:51 < hotdogs> because they were boolean keywords
09:52 < hotdogs> you'd have to search for "date:20121002T09:52:04" to find anything with it
09:53 < timmah> oh ok yeah
09:53 < timmah> that would be dumb
09:53 < timmah> and not useful
09:54 < hotdogs> if it wasn't boolean, you could hopefully search for "date:20121002T10*"
09:54 < hotdogs> but I don't care about that yet, and I think I can control time stuff like that more easily elsewhere
09:58 < timmah> usually I look for mac/ip/bid and then compare dates
10:01 < timmah> aww yeah
10:01 < timmah> no traffic for botnets today :)
10:05 < hotdogs> noooo
10:15 < timmah> feels good man
10:27 < timmah> hotdogs: I was looking at the guardian elite skills... holy crap
10:28 < hotdogs> yo?
10:30 < timmah> tome of courage for party support
10:30 < timmah> "fully heal up to 5 allies"

10:46 < timmah> omm nom nom knowledge
10:46 < gradius> essentially.
10:51 < hotdogs> timmah: I left it indexing yesterday but I forgot that it started at the beginning of the day
10:52 < hotdogs> so...it's still on yesterday
10:52 < hotdogs> fffff
10:52 < timmah> gradius: http://i.imgur.com/KqQP2.jpg
10:52 < timmah> hotdogs: so you're telling me it takes forever to index?
10:52 < hotdogs> maybe
10:54 < zero-one> timmah: fucking lol'd so hard
10:54 < hotdogs> I'm also not sure why the indexes were half the size that they were on my desktop

10:55 < timmah> ddup?
10:55 < timmah> brb MEETAN
10:59 < zero-one> dedup
11:06 < gradius> damn, trying to write an asyncronous irc lib. I feel so derp sometimes when it comes to coding.
11:06 < gradius> I think I got it though.
11:06 < gradius> (and I know I could use twisted, and I might)
11:06 < gradius> I just want to understand how it works first.
11:06 < zero-one> async? why?
11:07 < gradius> So I can more easily use other classes at the same time, also to prove to myself that I can do it.
11:07 < gradius> Mostly just to dispatch more than one class of the irc method.
11:07 < gradius> Just dicking around really.
11:08 < gradius> I didn't want to have to do all the data processing in the irc loop
11:08 < hotdogs> async is de best
11:08 < gradius> It seems fairly easy in python
11:09 < zero-one> you'll never need to process irc shit fast enough that async will ever be useful in that context
11:09 < gradius> Yes, but I want to organize my code :)
11:09 < gradius> It's a soul searching exercise.
11:09 < gradius> and because the only cool thing I do on the internet is IRC
11:10 < zero-one> hahaha
11:10 < hotdogs> wat
11:10 < hotdogs> async is a good idea for organization as much as it would be for performance
11:10 < hotdogs> non-blocking IO is de best
11:11 < hotdogs> it's more about not deadlocking, really.  but it's not like your bot is going to be handling more than one socket at a time anyway
11:11 < hotdogs> BUT YOU COULD
11:15 < gradius> Okay, at least I know I'm on the right track then.
11:16 < gradius> Because I was thinking that async was what I was supposed to use, and non-blocking IO is what I wanted.
11:16 < gradius> Now I just have to figure it out.
11:16 < gradius> Fuck work.
11:16 < gradius> This is my project for the day.
11:16 < gradius> lol.
11:18 < alexjandro> No games and booze today
11:38 < hotdogs> whoa whoa whoa
11:45 < timmah> SO HUNGRY
11:45 < hotdogs> I better beat the elevator rush
11:46 < timmah> DOOO IT
11:46 < timmah> I'll go grab the pizza from downstairs I guess
11:46 < timmah> hotdogs: save me a seat
12:17 < gradius> Woah, I miss swift meetings :(
12:17 < gradius> haha
12:18 < alexjandro> me too
13:08 < prometheusx> gradius: the room was packed today
13:11 < alexjandro> :|
13:11 < alexjandro> But how many people paid
13:12 < prometheusx> im not sure
13:14 < prometheusx> i think a bunch of people didn't pay because it was cash only
13:17 < prometheusx> i want to go bowling again
13:23 < gradius> prometheusx: Ah not bad. But yeah gotta find a way to get more people to pay :(
13:23 < gradius> hah
13:26 < prometheusx> gradius: we should look to getting a square account for swift
13:31 < gradius> yeah that mnight be nice
13:32 < gradius> just be wary fo the fees.
13:33 < prometheusx> 2.75%
13:58 < hotdogs> 2.much%
14:02 < prometheusx> hi
14:11 < hotdogs> hey buddy
14:13 < prometheusx> how was lunch?
14:15 < hotdogs> great
14:15 < hotdogs> how's whatever you're doing
14:40 < prometheusx> boring and not paying attention
15:25 < prometheusx> hotdogs: chocotaco
15:26 < alexjandro> hotdogs: replace the taco in that gif with a chocotaco
15:26 < prometheusx> YES!
15:28 < hotdogs> prometheusx: need to find a catears picture for this
16:05 < prometheusx> wait, wiat, for what?
16:12 < hotdogs> taco
16:13 < hotdogs> timmah: Closing db, 100000 recs, 20 flow time, 30.73 real time
16:13 < hotdogs> :(
16:13 < timmah> whoa
16:13 < timmah> das biggen
16:13 < hotdogs> more data than I can index
16:14 < timmah> srsly
16:16 < hotdogs> in a single thread, anyway
16:16 < hotdogs> anything faster becomes...more complicated
16:17 < timmah> ah
16:17 < timmah> and you can't multi-thread it
16:18 < hotdogs> sure I can!
16:19 < prometheusx> hotdogs: you're going to gif a taco in to her mouth?
16:19 < hotdogs> it just gets complicated
16:19 < hotdogs> prometheusx: hell yeah
16:19 < prometheusx> hope you send it to her when done
16:19 < prometheusx> post it on her facebook
16:19 < hotdogs> I don't think she has any open mouth pictures
16:20 < prometheusx> time to fake one!
16:34 < hotdogs> timmah: yeah, not sure what I want to do
16:35 < hotdogs> I could interleave them, make multiple threads that skip flow records then combine them after
16:35 < hotdogs> but it might be simpler to run one for this 100k records, then when another 100k shows up run another process for it...
16:36 < hotdogs> the problem with interleaving is that I don't think the output will be sorted right, but oh well
16:42 < timmah> yeah
16:43 < timmah> unless you do record numbers
16:43 < timmah> idono
16:44 < hotdogs> and these all have issues with restarting
16:48 < DrItanium> hotdogs: if you want to parallelize the db operations you have to schedule it
16:48 < hotdogs> wat
16:49 < DrItanium> If you multithread it then you run the risk of operations being executed out of order
16:49 < hotdogs> xapian is strictly single-writer
16:49 < hotdogs> if I parallelize, I have to write to separate indexes
16:49 < DrItanium> You need to schedule it which defines chains of execution. Each of those chains would go onto a different thread
16:49 < DrItanium> oh, we're on two different levels then
16:49 < hotdogs> so there's really no point to do threading
16:50 < hotdogs> also, currently using perl, so I can't do any sort of effective threading anyway
16:50 < DrItanium> I'm thinking how the high volume databases parallelize the actions requested by the user

00:09 < drboots> Someone's had too much to drink
00:43 < swiss> more than ones person
00:43 < swiss> <----
00:46 < alexjandro> Oh man I'm getting lucky tonight!
00:47 < hotdogs> with who?
00:47 < alexjandro> swiss
00:47 < alexjandro> i mean what
00:47 < hotdogs> I approve of this pairing
00:48 < alexjandro> YES
00:52 < swiss> what
00:52 < swiss> watu
00:52 < swiss> wahtever
00:52 < swiss> ANY PORT IN A STORM
00:52 < alexjandro> what
00:53 < alexjandro> Don't worry, I won't be doing the dicking
00:53 < alexjandro> I mean docking
00:53 < swiss> ;)
01:13 < drboots> Every time Im looking for trance online, alexjandro and swiss are gaying off
02:08 < swiss> not gaying off
02:08 < swiss> gaying on
02:08 < swiss> but it's ok
02:08 < swiss> because
02:11 < drboots> Speaking of you, swiss, it seems like a lot of old car meets are firing up again
02:12 < swiss> my car isn't calssified as "old' yet
02:12 < drboots> I meant old in the meet-thats-been-happening-for-awhile context
02:13 < drboots> The one by my house is firing up again, though everyone boned out to hit the nearby one at a Krispy Kreme
02:13 < drboots> then theres another near Montclair Plaza at a Starbucks off Mountain going on again.
02:14 < swiss> OH you mean the krispy kreme monthly stuffs
02:14 < swiss> there's a del sol one I think
02:14 < swiss> but I'm a bit............ not sober so i can't verify it's del sol
02:14 < swiss> i think it is!
02:16 < drboots> My friend has tabs on meets for miles, I could probably find one for you if it isnt the one you were thinking about already
02:17 < drboots> Just a shame that all his friends' eight-sixes are rattlecanned and sound like they have exhaust leaks
02:18 < drboots> alexjandro: I should be seeing you at some of these meets.  A lot more beemers are showing up these days to IE meets
02:18 < swiss> ITS SO TRUE
02:18 < swiss> everything that's good has been coorcpted
02:18 < swiss> corrubbertd
02:18 < swiss> corrupted
02:18 < swiss> tAHERE WE GO
02:21 < drboots> They're cool dudes, just wish they would dump the right amount of money to do it right on those eight sixes
02:22 < swiss> yep
02:22 < swiss> you sghout buidl all motor on those thigns
02:22 < swiss> and they'd be sick as HEL
02:22 < drboots> theres one guy I know that has a Takumi replica eight six.  20 valve and everything.  He just needs a proper ECU tune
02:22 < swiss> I'd drive a hatch one of htose in a heartbeat
02:23 < drboots> Drives smooth
02:24 < drboots> FC prices are coming back down.  Once I land a steady job I'll be grabbing one
02:24 < swiss> stop making me jizz my pants so much
02:24 < swiss> it's rude
02:24 < swiss> :P
02:24 < swiss> also, FD
02:24 < swiss> not FC
02:24 < swiss> do it right!
02:25 < drboots> I can step up.  I just need something to jump back into the culture
02:26 < swiss> FD is so much better
02:26 < swiss> I still hnngg over the veilside kit
02:26 < drboots> For FDs though, Im gonna have to go to Seattle.  All the ones down here are touched by amatuer hands.  The ones up north are usually virgin
02:27 < drboots> Its not unusual to find ones with 70-100K on chassis with fresh rebuilds and pure stock
02:28 < swiss> hnnnnnnnnnnnng
02:28 < swiss> how much do those run
02:28 < swiss> I'm thinking recently though, I'd like to build a baja bug
02:29 < swiss> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_Bug I want to do this
02:29 < swiss> so much fun
02:31 < drboots> Last I checked, such FDs ran 12-16K, depending on seller
02:31 < drboots> Rolling chassis prices have dropped to 4K recently
02:33 < swiss> Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
02:33 < swiss> not gonna afford that while in college
02:33 < swiss> Im considering trying the S14 route
02:35 < drboots> You might get lucky, but they usually run five digits
02:36 < drboots> For the FD, it's prettymuch the cost of the engine.  It's not like a Supra Mark IV, where the chassis itself is nearly five digits
02:37 < drboots> Even NA JZA80 still run for 13-17K
02:37 < drboots> Though seeing em for 20K is not unusual
02:39 < swiss> NOPE no JZ swap
02:39 < swiss> Rotarry is too jizztastic to take away from that caf
02:39 < swiss> car
02:39 < swiss> i don't care if it goes slower
02:39 < swiss> make it the rtoar
02:39 < swiss> rotary
02:53 < drboots> You can make it go faster with a rotary
02:53 < drboots> People mainly swap for reliability reasons / muscle fanboying
02:55 < drboots> Well, maybe cept the 2J swap, but 2Js are insane swaps in anything
02:56 < swiss> 2jzs are crazy
02:56 < swiss> BUT ROTARY IS SEXTY
02:56 < drboots> Agreed
02:56 < drboots> Im anxiously awaiting for Mazda to actually put the 16X to market
02:57 < drboots> Apparently an automotive mag did spot what seemed like a road prototype of the RX-9 awhile ago, but no word of it bein gthe genuine article or having a 16X
02:57 < swiss> mazdas are fun
02:57 < alexjandro> wat
02:57 < swiss> not gonna get another rotary for a while in the US
02:57 < swiss> alexjandro: friday is gonna be fuuuuuuuuun
02:58 < drboots> We'll get it.  Mazda is using some of Toyota's hybrid technology for the trans of the RX-9
02:58 < drboots> It's just a matter of them perfecting the 16X
02:58 < swiss> hmmmmmmmmmmmmm
02:58 < swiss> the issue with rotary is smog
02:58 < alexjandro> you mean Sat
02:59 < drboots> If anything, the smog issue will be a European thing, they discontinued in Europe due to emissions issue.  They discontinued worldwide due to sharply falling demand
03:05 < drboots> swiss:  Interesting fact, the RX-8 body is stiffer than the FD chassis.  Drop an FD motor in there (or an R26B four rotor) and you got a solid racer.  Speedsource won class in Trams Am with four rotor RX8s
03:06 < swiss> smog is issues everywhere
03:06  * swiss didn't have smog days,s os he says FUCK SMOG AND ALL THAT SHIT
03:07 < swiss> you know, drunk math homework was a bad idea
03:09 < drboots> It indeed is
03:09 < drboots> In the meantime, Im out for bed
08:14 < alexjandro> gradius: didn't your brothers car break or something after he sold it for wayy too cheap?
08:14 < alexjandro> I thought I remembered hearing something about that.
09:49 < timmah> I forgot my bowl at home :(
11:07 < gradius> lol yeah
11:07 < gradius> he didnt sell it for too cheap
11:07 < gradius> but cheaper than he should have
11:07 < gradius> but still
11:07 < gradius> engine blew up like 2 weeks later :|
11:07 < gradius> also, just won a ranked game as riven mid
11:07 < gradius> riven counter fid.

11:54 < timmah> rainbows: you still want to go to chipotle, don't you
11:54 < rainbows> i went yesterday
11:54 < rainbows> but possibly
11:54 < rainbows> :D
11:55 < hotdogs> how are we going to play settlers
11:55 < zero-one> hotdogs: lunch first
11:55 < zero-one> then class, then settlers
11:58 < hotdogs> I don't understand
11:58 < hotdogs> how are we going to play settlers
12:00 < zero-one> hotdogs: if we started 30 minutes ago, we'd have played until 12:15 or so
12:00 < zero-one> and then gone to lunch
12:01 < zero-one> i was mistaken, we can't play settlers anymore :(
12:01 < zero-one> not enough time
12:02 < hotdogs> fuck webapps that have the first connected user do setup
12:02 < hotdogs> why is this a good idea
12:02 < hotdogs> WHY
12:02 < swiss> hotdogs: tlel me the web address
12:02 < swiss> we'll race to set it up
12:05 < hotdogs> you wouldn't be able to connect anyway

17:09 < hotdogs> lets see what noon stuff looks like
17:09 < timmah> hotdogs: OOH DO IT
17:11 < hotdogs> timmah: 26 seconds down to 8 seconds
17:11 < hotdogs> so not linear
17:11 < timmah> wat

19:43 < hotdogs> haw haw haw
19:43 < hotdogs> pull from unstable
19:43 < zero-one> hotdogs: i am
19:44 < zero-one> -_-
19:44 < zero-one> this is a case where it looks like even sid doesn't have what i need
19:46 < hotdogs> they have 1.3.5 in rc-buggy
19:46 < hotdogs> no idea how you use it though
19:46 < hotdogs> http://packages.debian.org/experimental/deluge-web
19:52 < swiss> zero-one: change repos to wheezy
19:52 < swiss> wait wut
19:52 < swiss> what do you want that it doesn't have
19:53 < zero-one> >change repos to wheezy
19:53 < zero-one> >they've been at wheezy since i installed
19:58 < zero-one> swiss: you have root on the machine, you know this
19:59 < swiss> zero-one: meh, usually the issue is when people are on squeeze
19:59 < swiss> and I didn't bother to check, this intel driver is kicking my ass
20:00 < swiss> http://howfuckedismydistro.com/gentoo/
20:02 < zero-one> haha
20:03 < zero-one> http://howfuckedismydistro.com/debian/
20:47 < swiss> zero-one: so adding --no-mrproper --no-clean --no-postclear to genkernel just made my recompile time go from 1.5 hours to 2.5 minutes
20:58 < zero-one> lol
20:58 < zero-one> dat pentium
21:49 < swiss> So, after I finish this, i'm gonna copy the partition (back it up)
21:49 < swiss> and try and migrate to grub2
22:09 < DrItanium> swiss: I did it in 2010 and then again in 2011 with EFI no less
22:10 < DrItanium> it's pretty easy
22:34 < swiss> DrItanium: yeah, just waiting for kernet to finish
23:13 < airen> grub2 is shit
23:19 < swiss> airen: but fun sometimes
23:19 < swiss> and I like the idea of multiboot straight from iso
23:19 < airen> I dislike the idea of going back to lilo
23:19 < swiss> so I'll chainload it

09:11 -!- You're now known as timmah
11:20 < timmah> anyone in telecom?
11:24 < hotdogs> prometheusx: are youready yet
12:18 < DrItanium> airen: elilo isn't so bad
12:30 < airen> DrItanium: Making it so that the original system has to be up in order to modify boot information is dubm.
13:20 < swiss> i'm in telecom lab
13:25 < DrItanium> airen: you can modify the elilo configuration using the built in efi shell's tools
13:26 < DrItanium> lilo on the other hand.....
13:33 < airen> DrItanium: And Grub2...
13:38 < DrItanium> same...at least on the efi side...you can temporarily edit grub 1 configuration at boot though
13:39 < DrItanium> since grub2.efi and elilo.efi read from an external config file in the same system partition folder
13:44 < airen> You shouldn't need a script to parse the grubconfig and then make a real config out of it.
13:44 < airen> m4 all over again? No thanks.
13:45 < DrItanium> Well teh script for elilo could be easily replaced with some awk sed and grep commands and some cp's
13:46 < DrItanium> I've manually installed both elilo and grub to the service partition (I recommend it for grub2 efi actually)
13:46 < DrItanium> grub2 is easiler because you dont' need to copy the kernel and such, just the modules, configs, and the efi program
13:47 < airen> It works fine, but the design is flawed.
13:47 < DrItanium> see elilo doesn't read any other partitions but grub2 does
14:09 < DrItanium> unfortunately grub2 isn't supported on ia64 for some reason...I don't remember why but even though they have efi support they don't support itanium :( so -1 for grub2

13:48 < swiss> mendez: i'm gonna copy paste somethign lifted kilt just said
13:48 < alexjandro> prometheusx: soon
13:48 < swiss> so in my cs clas yesterday, I threw up a copy of the software that we need for the lab on my web server so that other people could get their
13:48 < swiss> copies of it more easily than passing around flash drives. This guy next to me refused to download the file until he spun up a vm, and opened it
13:48 < swiss> in the tor browser (default no scripts).
13:48 < swiss> ^The guy said it was cause of you that he did that
13:48 < prometheusx> swiss: i want to mess with your box from class
13:48 < swiss> prometheusx: i can reverse forward it
13:48 < mendez> swiss: yea he cp'd it to me
13:49 < mendez> i'm still laughing about it :D
13:53 < swiss> you know who it is you messed with?
14:19 < prometheusx> alexjandro: see if your n7 has an update!
14:21 < drboots> Has bitch week passed already for parking or is it still hell to find parking before 5?
14:28 < alexjandro> prometheusx: no, do you?

15:43 < alexjandro> it ends October 14th
15:43 < alexjandro> you have time
15:44 < timmah> I was also thinking of applying for a REI visa card
15:44 < timmah> for $100 gift card
15:44 < timmah> what do you think?
15:45 < alexjandro> Do I get the $100?
15:45 < timmah> no, it's for the credit card
15:45 < timmah> damn

15:47 < timmah> oh I don't _need_ anything
15:47 < timmah> but $180 off of this seemed pretty good
15:47 < timmah> http://www.rei.com/product/845181/contour-2-wearable-camcorder

15:49 < prometheusx> timmah: just buy that camera already
15:49 < alexjandro> timmah: sure, then pay off the credit card and close it
15:50 < hotdogs> open multiple REI credit cards

15:50 < timmah> hotdogs: thought about that
15:51 < timmah> you have to make at least 1 purchase with the card
15:51 < alexjandro> Gum
15:51 < timmah> THEN they send it
15:51 < alexjandro> 1 pack of gum
15:51 < hotdogs> condoms
15:51 < hotdogs> adventure condoms
15:51 < alexjandro> Outdoor Condoms
15:52 < timmah> gummy condoms?

16:50 < timmah> alexjandro: I've decided to wait for it
16:50 < alexjandro> wait for what?
16:50 < timmah> wait for the $100 giftcard
16:51 < timmah> half price is pretty good
16:52 < hotdogs> but if you have a $100 gift card, shouldn't you spend it on things you need
16:53 < timmah> it's for REI
16:55 < hotdogs> they sell clothes and stuff
16:57 < timmah> also true
16:57 < timmah> I do need a few things...

18:25 < gradius2> I am ronery.
18:25 < gradius2> Just waiting for something to break at regionals
18:25 < gradius2> Though, hanging out with the pro team is kinda fun
18:26 < hotdogs> too bad they play lol
18:26 < gradius2> Hahah.
18:27 < gradius2> What's wrong with LoL
18:27 < gradius2> JERK
18:27 < hotdogs> AWFUL
18:27 < gradius2> YOU'RE JUST BAD
18:27 < gradius2> YOU WISH YOU WERE GOOD AT IT
18:27 < gradius2> actually
18:27 < hotdogs> YES
18:27 < gradius2> have you played recently?
18:27 < hotdogs> no
18:27 < gradius2> I haven't seen you on
18:27 < gradius2> What have you been gamin bro?
18:27 < gradius2> GW2?
18:27 < hotdogs> gw2
18:27 < hotdogs> and tl2
18:27 < hotdogs> probably going to play xcom and dishonored at some point
18:28 < hotdogs> borderlands 2 is on that list too
18:28 < hotdogs> see? why would I play league
18:28 < hotdogs> there's lots of new hotness
18:29 < gradius2> dishonored looks pretty badass
18:29 < gradius2> Yeah, that's true
18:30 < hotdogs> let's talk to eachother in two channels
18:30 < gradius2> I just have so man games already.
18:30 < gradius2> Yes, we should
18:30 < hotdogs> you have lots of games
18:30 < hotdogs> and you don't play any of them
18:30 < gradius2> Though I try to keep my video game chat in this channel
18:30 < gradius2> SHUT UP
18:30 < gradius2> I know :(
18:30 < gradius2> I need to stop buying things.
18:30 < gradius2> I've been playing mostly LoL/GW2
18:30 < gradius2> Oh and some FTL when I get a chance.
18:30 < hotdogs> I haven't really seen you on gw2
18:31 < gradius2> yeah, I jump on every now and then but havent been on a lot
18:31 < gradius2> Mostly when haven and I play together.
18:31 < hotdogs> I FIGURED.
18:31 < gradius2> Yeah, though I am having a blast with mesmer and greatsword.
18:31 < gradius2> Fucking awesome.
18:32 < hotdogs> I made a mesmer
18:32 < hotdogs> takes too much effort, back to thief
18:32 < gradius2> I do like GW, but its really hard to play a lot since the reason I can play LoL is because it's easier to play at work
18:32 < gradius2> lol too much effor?
18:32 < hotdogs> have to manage clones
18:32 < gradius2> its fun though bro.
18:32 < gradius2> Yeah.
18:32 < gradius2> That's kind of annoying.
18:32 < hotdogs> manage debuffing
18:33 < hotdogs> thief is...you want mob dead? mash 2
18:33 < gradius2> Yeah, I haven't gone higher than like 10 on my Mesmer
18:33 < gradius2> so
18:33 < hotdogs> cooldowns? what are those?
18:33 < gradius2> lololol
18:33 < gradius2> True
18:33 < hotdogs> oh, I got to 15
18:33 < gradius2> What are your main weps on theif?
18:33 < hotdogs> dagger/pistol/sword/shortbow
18:33 < gradius2> Hmm, I should try the dagger pistol.
18:33 < hotdogs> sword is mainhand-only, shortbow is 2h, dagger/pistol can be offhands
18:33 < gradius2> I have dual dagger right now.
18:34 < gradius2> and shortbow offhand.
18:34 < gradius2> I just need to get my hands on better pistols.
18:34 < hotdogs> I used to do double dagger but moved to dp
18:34 < gradius2> Mostly just boring drops
18:34 < hotdogs> DP and SP let you blind-tank
18:35 < gradius2> ah, yeah I've been getting good with that tele.
18:35 < gradius2> I really wanan try some more WvW too
18:36 < gradius2> But havent felt like I've done enoguh of the PvE
18:37 < hotdogs> I wouldn't really do wvw without, say, 30
18:37 < hotdogs> so you have an elite
18:38 < hotdogs> also, you should be wearing green gear for your level
18:38 < hotdogs> dat TP
18:41 < gradius2> That makes sense.

11:08 < timmah> okay
11:09 < gradius> BAD FINGERS
11:12 < gradius> So, I think I need to adjust my markov chains a bit.... This is after sampling from Alice in Wonderland
11:12 < gradius> was walrus beating. others her ears the six and you're it, learn?' you she shining on her. And in was
11:13 < airen> gradius: Sample LoTR
11:13 < gradius> airen: do you know if there's somewhere I can get a .txt of it?
11:13 < gradius> Only reason I used what I used is because I knew where a .txt was.
11:13 < airen> http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/book/
11:13 < gradius> :)
11:14 < gradius> Awesome, more sample material is always good.
11:15 < gradius> Oh god LOL
11:15 < gradius> This is AWESOME.
11:16 < gradius> airen: ilu
11:16 < gradius> haha
11:17 < gradius> This is for sure going into my default seeding.
11:21 < gradius> "Hold it right there.  This story is
11:21 < gradius> racist enough as it is; we don't need any comments about 'Black
11:21 < gradius> Breath' making it worse."
11:34 < timmah> prometheusx: food?
11:38 < prometheusx> timmah: nah, need to write a letter that's due tomorrow so we can go bowling
11:39 < timmah> rgr
11:39 < timmah> do it
11:40 < zero-one> bowling is for fags
11:40 < prometheusx> zero-one: so you want to go?
11:40 < zero-one> tomorrow?
11:40 < zero-one> or today?
11:40 < timmah> prometheusx: he just wants to hold our balls
11:40 < prometheusx> our balls do like to be held
11:41 < zero-one> prometheusx: i thought your balls were out of commission
11:42 < prometheusx> should be back on the job today!
12:24 < drboots> Holy shit we got some loud thunder at my place
12:24 < zero-one> blargh
12:24 < zero-one> i don't understand
12:24 < zero-one> lspci reports a PCIe ethernet controller
12:24 < alexjandro> drboots: Welcome to 20 minutes ago
12:24 < zero-one> but there are no PCI devices in this machine
12:25 < zero-one> i'm plugging right into the onboard ethernet
12:25 < drboots> alexjandro: Most of the thunder and lightning strikes are over my house and have been for 30 minutes
12:25 < swiss> put more devices in then
12:26 < swiss> zero-one: you can hook up pci devices that aren't in a PCI slot
12:26 < zero-one> doesn't PCI describe the bus?
12:27 < zero-one> if it's not on the pci bus, it's not a pci device
12:27 < prometheusx> im hnugry
13:11 < timmah> prometheusx: too late
13:34 < prometheusx> yup, im in class!
13:36 < hotdogs> zero-one: wat
13:37 < hotdogs> what other bus is an integrated card going to sit on
13:38 < hotdogs> all of the bundled shit on a board is either in the northbridge or hardwired into the pci/pcie bus
13:38 < hotdogs> or the southbridge, I guess
13:39 < hotdogs> even those might show up as pci devices
13:42 < alexjandro> zero-one: go read the wikipedia page
14:29 < DrItanium> zero-one: PCIe shows up as a pci device. This was an intentional choice on the part of the PCIe devs
14:30 < DrItanium> Plus, onboard ethernet controllers are still usually connected to the rest of the system via PCIe
14:33 < zero-one> got it
16:39 < gradius> I think I hurt girldius' feelings.
16:39 < gradius> 16:39 <@gradius> girldius: why are you a pain?
16:39 < gradius> 16:39 < girldius> pain?  a what what   is a pain?
16:43 < hotdogs> gradius: anything but work, huh
16:46 < airen> gradius: Where is bot?
16:47 < alexjandro> airen: I FOUND IT
16:52 < gradius> 16:52 < alexjandro> girldius: error
16:52 < gradius> 16:52 < girldius> make  reply?    error come
16:53 < gradius> it's in #testgradius2, but i'll move it over here even in its broken state.
16:53 < gradius> gimme a sec
16:53 < alexjandro> for everyone to see
16:53 < alexjandro> http://pastebin.com/dbFsyFPa
16:54 < hotdogs> what the hell is wrong with your bot
16:54 < gradius> hotdogs: I'm not sure yet.
16:55 < gradius> There's a shitton wrong with the way I generate things.
16:55 -!- girldius [~girldius@209.133.52.233] has joined #testgradius
16:55 < gradius> I'm doing a lot of sloppy shit.
16:55 < hotdogs> aww yeah
16:55 < gradius> and the generator throws random python errors a LOT
16:55 < gradius> and she doesn't save chain state when close.
16:56 < gradius> closed, so that means it starts over after every reset.
16:56 < gradius> That's why I didnt have her in here since I was doing EXTREME DEBUGGING
16:56 < hotdogs> yay
16:56 < hotdogs> markov chains?
16:56 < gradius> Yeah.
16:56 < hotdogs> sexy
16:56 < gradius> I think I may have some of the implementation of the chaining off though :(
16:57 < gradius> And bad generation doesn't help.
16:57 < gradius> But maybe I haven't given it enough sample data.
16:57 < gradius> Still doing a LOT of tests.
16:57 < gradius> Lemme turn her replies on now that I've typed a lot into the channel.
16:57 < gradius> She might say something....
16:57 < gradius> girldius: say something?
16:57 < girldius> something? something? something? say something?  say   something?
16:57 < gradius> NOPE.jpg
16:58 < gradius> At least she's not saying her name over and over again like she did before.
16:58 < hotdogs> I don't know where my generator stuff went
16:58 < gradius> girldius: why are you bad?
16:58 < hotdogs> I should make the rainbows generator
16:58 < gradius> See, I just got an index error
17:01 < drboots> hotdogs: Do it
17:01 < drboots> Weather's having another bitch fit at my place, but the thunder isn't nearly as loud as it was this morning
17:02 < hotdogs> I think I'm going to purposely not park in my covered spot
17:02 < hotdogs> so the dust gets washed off

17:08 < airen> girldius: girldius I slowly pulled my panties down, willingly exposing my round ass and wet pussy to him. He stepped up behind me, pressing me against the counter and nestling his cock against my pussy. He started to move his hips back and forth, sliding that long hard cock against my pussy lips and my clit, aided by the creamy wetness that had been seeping out of me since dinner. It felt even better than his fingers. While he did this, he kissed and nu

17:27 < airen> I am trained in Free Software Evangelizing and I’m the top code contributer for the entire GNU HURD. You are nothing to me but just another compile time error. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.
17:27 < airen> You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am building a GUI using GTK+ and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.
17:27 < airen> You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can decompile you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my Model M. Not only am I extensively trained in EMACS, but I have access to the entire arsenal of LISP functions and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

17:33 < hotdogs> so I whipped up a quick rainbows markov chain
17:33 < hotdogs> based on letters
17:33 < hotdogs> it produces complete garbage
17:33 < hotdogs> so I think it's accurate
17:36 < gradius> lolol
17:37 < hotdogs> it's currently using two tokens
17:37 < hotdogs> maybe if I push it to three...
17:39 < drboots> Someone type a number between 0 and 100
17:39 < airen> 9001
17:42 < airen> hotdogs: What's your opinion on POE?
17:43 < gradius> 6
17:43 < airen> Ugh, I need to learn perl's OO shit.
17:48 < airen> It looks ugly.
18:59 < hotdogs> poe is gr8
18:59 < hotdogs> it's what botwurst uses
18:59 < airen> I should rewrite stallmanbot to use it.
18:59 < airen> Instead of my janky socket code.
18:59 < hotdogs> it would be a lot shorter
19:00 < airen> Do you have a seperate config?
19:00 < hotdogs> hm?
19:02 < airen> Where you define the channel and stuff
19:02 < airen> I don't want to bake that into the code.
19:02 < airen> Don't know if perl has a decent method for those, I know python does.
19:02 < airen> Ah, Config::Simple looks like what I want.
19:03 < airen> or Config::Tiny
19:03 < hotdogs> yep
19:04 < airen> TIME TO CPAN IT UP
19:04 < hotdogs> my jacket smells like floor :(
19:06 < airen> D:
19:16 < airen> hotdogs: WICKED CPAN'ING IT DUDE
19:18 < hotdogs> whoa whoa whoa

19:20 < hotdogs> http://blogs.perl.org/users/oliver_gorwits/2011/07/locallibs-for-dist-development.html
19:21 < airen> That's what I'm doin
19:23 < hotdogs> oh snap
19:24 < airen> OH SNAP
19:35 < airen> Hmmm
19:35 < airen> Not sure that Config::Tiny supports variables that are arrays
19:35 < airen> Meh, i'll just split it.
19:36 < hotdogs> yep
19:36 < hotdogs> I wanted a hash for one thing, so I made a [block] that contains it
19:37 < airen> Don't need a hash for an array of channels.
19:37 < hotdogs> JUST SAYIN'
19:37 < hotdogs> you can abuse it still
19:41 < airen> Sounds good.
19:41 < airen> Rewritin' dat shizzle
20:10 < airen> Oh man.
20:10 < airen> So many plugins.
20:13 < hotdogs> for POE?
20:22 < airen> Yeah.
20:23 < hotdogs> yep
20:23 < airen> Kinda wondering if I'm overengineering it.
20:23 < airen> I think there is a bot::simple or something.
20:23 < hotdogs> nooooooooooo
20:23 < hotdogs> though you can pretty much do it using the example from the pod
20:24 < airen> I just felt weird not touching any perl today.
20:24 < airen> I don't really have a use for this bot.
20:25 < hotdogs> of course

18:31 < gradius> Woot, my markov chains are working MUCH better now. Now I have to just get a generate function working :)
18:37 < prometheusx> gradius: make her join now!
18:38 < gradius> also, if you name a varible "len" in python
18:38 < gradius> and expect to get length of lists.
18:38 < gradius> you're going to have a bad time.
18:38 < gradius> :|
18:38 < gradius> prometheusx: generate function not implemented yet.
18:38 < gradius> working on that now.
19:01 < prometheusx> bah
19:01 < prometheusx> !
19:02 < gradius> almost done, getting some profound statements.
19:07 < gradius> hotdogs: I know you keep logs, mind linking me to some?
19:07 < gradius> I'd like to seed my bot w/ them if you can :)
19:09 < prometheusx> gradius: he's pooping
19:09 < gradius> lolk
19:10 < prometheusx> he's in an intense corn race
19:10 < gradius> Idk if he saves them to files.
19:10 < gradius> hotdogs: if you could just upload them to the web, ill grab em and then let you knnow
19:10 < gradius> that way I have some seeds.
19:10 < gradius> prometheusx: gimme a word to use as a test.
19:10 < gradius> I just wanna see what I get from my two seed files
19:11 < gradius> nm
19:15 < prometheusx> balls
19:22 < hotdogs> gradius: my irc logs?
21:39 < gradius> hotdogs: yes your logs.
21:43 < gradius> this feels like it might end bad.

21:55 < drboots> Are you trying to make it repeat the same sentence or are you trying to build a database of words to use?
21:55 < gradius> kinda
21:55 < gradius> using markov chains to generate sentences.
21:56 < gradius> but I think my sentence genration is messed up when I moved it to the bot
21:56 < gradius> since when I test the library on it's own, it works fine.
