[10:58:21] <LiftedKilt> wow. So apparently at my work there is one dns/dhcp server that is running the first version of debian, and can no longer be updated.
[10:58:25] <Ikenga> i'll come to you guys when I need scores changed on a server somewhere
[10:58:39] <LiftedKilt> and if it ever goes down, it won't come back up without a ton of coaxing

[10:59:09] <wedgie> what was that? woody?
[10:59:11] <wedgie> I don't even know
[10:59:12] <LiftedKilt> that was verbatim what the sysadmin told me

[10:59:57] <timmah> gradius: I blame hype
[11:00:03] <gradius> agreed.
[11:00:41] <prometheusx> they also spent, i tihnk 5+ years working on the first one before it got picked up
[11:00:42] <LiftedKilt> that may be hyperbole, but yeah apparently it is so messed up that nobody at Harvey Mudd is willing to touch it
[11:01:07] <Ikenga> lol. 
[11:01:11] <Ikenga> harvey mudd?

[11:01:40] <wedgie> LiftedKilt: sounds like it may be time to upgrade that bad boy. What else is on it besides dns and dhcp?
[11:01:50] <hotdogs> dns/dhcp is the easiest thing to migrate.  I bet your config will just work
[11:01:51] <prometheusx> fff, wifi is laggy as hell and dropping packets
[11:02:07] <hotdogs> slowest moving software ever
[11:02:21] <wedgie> hotdogs: i think the term you are looking for is "stable"
[11:02:25] <hotdogs> that's how wifi works
[11:03:04] <gradius> hahah
[11:03:09] <hotdogs> yes, stable as in unchanging
[11:03:51] <hotdogs> also, I don't think I've really seen the first matrix entirely, but I also have no desire to
[11:06:00] <gradius> It's really not a bad movie.

[11:26:30] <timmah>   Call me Ishmael. Some years ago -- never mind how long precisely -- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen, and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pau
[11:26:31] <gradius> prometheusx: good work
[11:26:37] <timmah> There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs -- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme down-town is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
[11:26:43] <timmah> Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall northward. What do you see? -- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks
[11:26:48] <timmah> MARKOV THAT, BITCH
[11:26:51] <gradius> lolol.
[11:26:55] <prometheusx> gradius: does she learn through pms?
[11:27:00] <gradius> hmmm
[11:27:03] <gradius> I dont actually know
[11:27:05] <timmah> prometheusx: she's a bot, she doesn't need to have pms
[11:27:13] <timmah> why you would program that is beyond me
[11:27:23] <timmah> gradius: can she learn from logs?
[11:27:25] <timmah> because I have logs.
[11:27:33] <prometheusx> for maximum frustration!
[11:27:33] <gradius> har har at the pms joke
[11:27:36] <gradius> and yea she can
[11:27:39] <gradius> I would love it

[11:28:01] <prometheusx> gradius: join it to swift now?
[11:28:18] <timmah> gradius: should I format the logs at all?
[11:28:38] <gradius> line by line is how she learns

[11:29:22] <gradius> and no joinging to #swift, I've already joined/parted too much for now
[11:29:35] <gradius> and she has too high a reply percent chance
[11:29:40] <gradius> its 10% right now
[11:29:44] <prometheusx> gotcha
[11:30:06] <gradius> need to be able to change seeds, view the markov chain + set the reply chance while she's running

[14:10:44] <gradius> That ALMOST made sense.
[14:11:35] <airen> I have a PhD in Digital Music Conservation from the University of South Carolina. I have to stress that the phenomenon known as "digital dust" is the real problem regarding conservation of music, and any other type of digital file. Digital files are stored in digital filing cabinets called "directories" which are prone to "digital dust" - slight bit alterations that happen now or then.
[14:11:41] <airen> Now, admittedly, in its ideal, pristine condition, a piece of musical work encoded in FLAC format contains more information than the same piece encoded in MP3, however, as the FLAC file is bigger, it accumulates, in fact, MORE digital dust than the MP3 file. Now you might say that the density of dust is the same. That would be a naive view.
[14:11:46] <airen> Since MP3 files are smaller, they can be much more easily stacked together and held in "drawers" called archive files (Zip, Rar, Lha, etc.) ; in such a configuration, their surface-to-volume ratio is minimized. Thus, they accumulate LESS digital dust and thus decay at a much slower rate than FLACs. All this is well-known in academia, alas the ignorant hordes just think that because it's bigger, it must be better.
[14:11:52] <airen> Hearing the difference now isn't the reason to encode to FLAC. FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is 'lossy'. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it's about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don't want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.
[14:11:58] <airen> I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap.
[14:12:01] <airen> The bass is terrible, the midrange...well don't get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren't stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you'll be glad you did.
[14:12:06] <airen> HI, BILLY MAYS HERE WITH KABOOM. DO YOU HAVE LOTS OF DIRTY SHIT IN YOUR HOUSE THAT NEEDS ALL CLEANED UP? THEN BUY SOME OF THIS GODDAMN KABOOM. THIS SHIT COULD CLEAN THE WARTS OFF YOUR SISTER'S VAGINA. YOU CAN PUT SOME KABOOM ON YOUR DICK, AND IT'LL GROW THREE INCHES. FUCK.

[14:12:23] <airen> CALL NAO!
[14:12:25] <airen> What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little proprietry bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the FSF, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Apple patents, and I have over 300 confirmed bug fixes.
[14:12:29] <airen> I am trained in Free Software Evangelizing and I’m the top code contributer for the entire GNU HURD. You are nothing to me but just another compile time error. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words.
[14:12:34] <airen> You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am building a GUI using GTK+ and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life.
[14:12:39] <airen> You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can decompile you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my Model M. Not only am I extensively trained in EMACS, but I have access to the entire arsenal of LISP functions and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.
[14:12:44] <airen> If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit Freedom all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking debugged, kiddo.

[14:13:14] <airen> I'm a 27 year old American Otaku (Anime fan for you gaijins). I draw Anime and Manga on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)
[14:13:19] <airen> I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.
[14:13:22] <airen> I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%
[14:13:25] <airen> When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!
[14:13:29] <airen> I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.
[14:13:34] <airen> I’d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX. Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system ev

[15:15:37] [Connected at Wed Oct 17 15:15:37 2012]
[15:15:51] <zero-one> girldius: welcome back
[15:15:51] <girldius> girldius: welcome back
[15:16:02] <gradius> I'll unsilent her and put her 30%
[15:16:12] <gradius> silent
[15:16:14] <zero-one> see what makes her sound most natural
[15:16:23] <gradius> percent 30%
[15:16:25] <gradius> percent 30
[15:16:29] <gradius> Yeah.
[15:16:35] <gradius> 30 seems kind of high.
[15:16:42] <zero-one> hm...
[15:16:48] <zero-one> looks like it might be just right, actually
[15:16:52] <zero-one> or maybe not
[15:16:59] <gradius> lets start with 15% and move up
[15:17:06] <gradius> percent 15
[15:17:22] <gradius> I think she was trying to be flirty....
[15:17:26] <gradius> not sure.
[15:17:43] <gradius> someone click that link.
[15:18:25] <zero-one> nope
[15:18:37] <zero-one> she might have gotten it from Kos
[15:18:39] <zero-one> <_<
[15:18:40] <zero-one> >_>
[15:18:56] <gradius> That's also very true.
[15:19:06] <zero-one> i clicked it
[15:19:19] <zero-one> gradius: it's a picture of a piece of rusted metal
[15:20:49] <gradius> lol that works too
[15:21:28] <gradius> I should git clone the code to a webserver that people cant pin back to an IP
[15:21:39] <gradius> and join her to swift with a random name.
[15:21:45] <gradius> with like 5% talk chance.
[15:21:55] <gradius> For science?
[15:21:57] <zero-one> gradius: DO IT
[15:22:00] <gradius> kk
[15:22:14] <zero-one> but first make sure that 5% actually ACTS Like 5%
[15:22:27] <gradius> well 15% is working right I think
[15:22:33] <gradius> She seems to be quiet enough
[15:22:35] <gradius> maybe 2%
[15:22:47] <zero-one> I think 5% might be good
[15:22:50] <zero-one> 2 might be too small
[15:22:51] <gradius> alright
[15:22:52] <gradius> yah
[15:24:35] <zero-one> gradius: change her client to "IceChat"
[15:25:31] <prometheusx> yeah, 5% is good

[15:33:02] <zero-one> girldius: what kind of nick do you want?
