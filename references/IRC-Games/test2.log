[16:55:26] <gradius> I'm doing a lot of sloppy shit.
[16:55:31] <hotdogs> aww yeah
[16:55:49] <gradius> and the generator throws random python errors a LOT
[16:55:57] <gradius> and she doesn't save chain state when close.
[16:56:09] <gradius> closed, so that means it starts over after every reset.
[16:56:26] <gradius> That's why I didnt have her in here since I was doing EXTREME DEBUGGING
[16:56:28] <hotdogs> yay
[16:56:35] <hotdogs> markov chains?
[16:56:36] <gradius> Yeah.
[16:56:40] <hotdogs> sexy
[16:56:53] <gradius> I think I may have some of the implementation of the chaining off though :(
[16:57:01] <gradius> And bad generation doesn't help.
[16:57:09] <gradius> But maybe I haven't given it enough sample data.
[16:57:20] <gradius> Still doing a LOT of tests.
[16:57:32] <gradius> Lemme turn her replies on now that I've typed a lot into the channel.
[16:57:37] <gradius> She might say something....
[16:57:42] <gradius> silent
[16:57:46] <gradius> girldius: say something?

[16:58:05] <gradius> At least she's not saying her name over and over again like she did before.
[16:58:06] <hotdogs> I don't know where my generator stuff went
[16:58:11] <gradius> girldius: why are you bad?
[16:58:17] <hotdogs> I should make the rainbows generator
[16:58:18] <gradius> See, I just got an index error
[17:01:16] <drboots> hotdogs: Do it
[17:01:58] <drboots> Weather's having another bitch fit at my place, but the thunder isn't nearly as loud as it was this morning
[17:02:30] <hotdogs> I think I'm going to purposely not park in my covered spot

He stepped up behind me, pressing me against the counter and nestling his cock against my pussy. He started to move his hips back and forth, sliding that long hard cock against my pussy lips and my clit, aided by the creamy wetness that had been seeping out of me since dinner. It felt even better than his fingers. While he did this, he kissed and nu
